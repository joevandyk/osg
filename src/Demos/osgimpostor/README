Note: Using sgv with Peformer (for IRIX and Linux users only)
=============================================================

If you find problems with loading .pfb files its likely that its due to undefined
symbols.  This isn't a problem with the OSG implementation, but alas the only
current solution is to directly link you app with the Performer libraries. The 
Makefile contains two library list.  In Makefile you'll see something like :

    #note, use this library list when using the Performer osgPlugin.
    #LIBS = ${PFLIBS} -losgGLUT -losgDB -losg -lGLU -lGL  -lm -lXmu  -lX11 -lXi

    #note, standard library list. 
    LIBS = -losgGLUT -losgDB -losg -lGLU -lGL  -lm -lXmu  -lX11 -lXi

Simple comment in the LIBS line with PFLIBS and comment out the standard LIBS,
then :

    make clean
    make

Hopefully the Performer distribution will eventually work as a dynamic plugin 
but until that day we're stuck with this 'hack'...
