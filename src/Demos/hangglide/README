A simple hang gliding flight simulator demo. The current GliderManipulator 
does not yet have any dynamics built into it, something TODO...

A small database is built into the program - Ed Levin park, Don's local flying 
to be precise! You'll need the textures found in the OpenSceneGraph-Data 
distribution. To run type :

    hangglide

To run type with other databases, treat it just like sgv such as :

    hangglide town.osg
