This shared library can load both VRML1.0 and Inventor (they are practically
the same, only changes the header).

Features:

* Polygonal geometry (IndexedFaceSet)
* Materials
* Transformations
* External Textures (no inline ones)
* Doesn't crash when unknown nodes or attributes are found, only ignores
them.

To-Do:

* Use the new Geometry node of osg 0.9.0 that has support of vertex arrays
* Use the front face attribute (clockwise/counterclockwise) 
* Implement more nodes. Maybe the cone, sphere, etc could be implemented
  with a fixed number of polygons, always the same, or maybe as a LOD node,
  that uses more or less polys depending on the distance to the camera.
