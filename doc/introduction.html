<h2>Introduction to the OpenSceneGraph</h2>

<p>Welcome to OpenSceneGraph project!
</p>
<p>In this document I'll introduce what a scene graph is, what the OpenSceneGraph project encompasses, and provide tips on how to learn how to use it
and to contact or contribute to the OpenSceneGraph community.

<h2>What is a Scene Graph?</h2>
</p>Its a tree! Quite simply one the best and most reusable datastructures invented.Typically drawn schematically as
root at the top, leaves at the bottom. It all starts with a topmost root node which
encompasses your whole virtual world, be it 2D or 3D. The world is then broken down
into hierachy of nodes represent either a spatial grouping of objects,
set the position of or animate objects,. or define a logical relationship between objects such as to manage
the various states of a traffic light.The leaves of the graph represent the phyical objects
themselves, the drawable geometry and their material properties.

<h2>Why use a Scene Graph - Performance, Productivity, Portability and Scalability.</h2>

</p><i>Performance</i> - scene graphs provide an excellent framework for maximize graphics
performance. A good scene graph employs two key techinques - culling of the objects that won't
be seen on screen, and state sorting of properties such as textures and materials
so that all similar objects are drawn together. Without culling the CPU, buses and
GPU will all become swamped by many times the amount of data tham they acual require.to represent
you work accurately. The hierachical structure of the scene graph makes this culling
process.very efficient.with whole town being culled with just a few operations! Without state storting, the the buses and GPU will thrash between
states, stalling the graphics and destroying graphisc throughout.  As GPU's get faster and faster, the cost of
stalling the graphics is also going up, so scene graph are become ever more important.
</p>

</p><i>Productivity</i> - scene graphs take much of the hardwork required to develop
high perftomance graphics applications. The scene graphs manage all the graphics for you,
reducing what would be thousands of lines of OpenGL down to a few simple calls..Furthermoe,
one of most powerfukl concepts in Object Orientated programming is that of object
compotsition, enshrined in <i>Composite Design Pattern</i>, which fits the scene graph
tree strucutre perfectly which makes it highly flexible and reusable design - in real terms
this means that it can be easily adapted it to solve your problems. Scene graph also often come
additional utilitie libraries which range for helping users set up and manage graphics
windows to import of 3d modes and images.  All this together allows the user to achieve
a great deal with very little coding.A dozen lines of code can be enough to load your data
and create an interactive viewer!
</p>

</p><i>Portability</i> - scene graphs encapsulate much of the lower level tasks of rendering
graphics and reading and writing data, reducing or even eradicating the platform specific
coding that you require in your own application. If the underlying scene graph is portable
then moving from platform to platform can be a simple as recompiling your source code.
</p>

</p><i>Scalability</i> - along with being able to dynamic manage the complexity of scenes
automatically to account for differences in graphics performance across a range of machines,
scene graphs also make it much easier to manage complex hardware configurations, such as clusters
of graphics machines, or multiprocessor/multipipe systems such as SGI's Onyx. A good scene graph
will allow the developer to concentrate on developing their own application while rendering
framework of the scene graph handles the differnt underlying hardware configurations.
