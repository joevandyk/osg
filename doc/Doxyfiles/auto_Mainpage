The <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/">OpenSceneGraph</a> exists
as a number of modules, each sitting in its own library, enclosed within
its own namespace.

At the very core lies the osg library. This contains the Open Scene
Graph's central classes and, at the bare minimum, it is all users need
to write an OpenSceneGraph program. Its only requirements are
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/">Standard C++</a> and
<a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> and OpenThreads.

Around and alongside this sit other supporting libraries, such as osgUtil
(containing visitors for app traversals, cull traversals, scene graph
optimizers and so on), osgDB (for handling plug-ins, shared library loading
and the like), osgText, osgParticle, etc. A full list can be seen by clicking
on the Namespace List link above.

Tarballs of this documentation may be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/download/dox/">here</a>.

Enjoy!
