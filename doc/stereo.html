<h1>
<b><i><u>Stereo</u></i></b></h1>
The OSG has support for stereo out of the box.  Currently both anaglyphic stereo (i.e. red/green glasses)
and quad buffered stereo (i.e. active stereo using shutter glasses, or passive stereo using polarised
projectors & glasses).  It is planned to extend this support horizontal and
virtual window split based stereo implementations. 

Almost all OSG applications have the potential for support simply by setting
the relevent environmental variables, or via command line arguments.  Little or
no code changes will be required, the support is handled transparently inside
osgUtil::SceneView's handling of rendering.

If the user is planning to use head tracked stereo, or a cave then it is
currently recommend to set it via a VR toolkit such as VRJuggler, in this
case refer to the VR toolkits handling of stereo, and do not invoke the
OSG's native support, i.e. keep all the stereo specific environment set to
OFF, or set the values to off within there own applications.

The environmental variables of interest:

    OSG_STEREO          ON              turn stereo on.
    OSG_STEREO          OFF             turn stereo off (default)

    OSG_STEREO_MODE     ANAGLYPHIC      use anaglyphic stereo when in stereo (default).
    OSG_STEREO_MODE     QUAD_BUFFER     use quad buffered stereo when in stereo.

    OSG_SCREEN_DISTANCE 0.50            set the distance the viewer is from screen in metres (default shown)
    OSG_SCREEN_HEIGHT   0.26            set the height if image on the screen in metres (default shown)

Command line arguments can be used to override these settings:

    -stereo               Switch on stereo.
    -stereo ON            Switch on stereo.
    -stereo OFF           Switch off stereo.
    -stereo ANAGLYPHIC    Switch on ANAGLYPHIC stereo.
    -stereo QUAD_BUFFER   Switch on QUAD_BUFFER stereo.

Examples:

    To invoke stereo from the comandline:

      sgv -stereo cow.osg

    To invoke quad buffered stereo from the commandline:

      sgv -stereo QUAD_BUFFER cow.osg

    To force all apps to start up in quad buffered stereo (if system supports it)

      export OSG_STEREO=ON
      export OSG_STEREO_MODE=QUAD_BUFFER

      sgv cow.osg

    To set quad buffered stereo to the default, but use the commandline to
    switch stereo on:

      export OSG_STEREO=OFF
      export OSG_STEREO_MODE=QUAD_BUFFER

      sgv -stereo cow.osg
