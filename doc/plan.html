<h2>
<u>Plans for future developments</u></h2>
Now we have reached the beta phase (0.9.x) of OpenScenegGraph project,
and are now working towards the full 1.0 release, with a likely 
release date in fall 2002.

<h3>
Fturue work include:</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Multi-pass fallback for when multi-texturing is not supported.</li>

<li>
Clean up the API for managing multi-stage and multi-pass rendering within
the scene graph.</li>

<li>
Replace osgGLUT with a cleaner windowing API for the demos, move osgGLUT
out of the distribution and into the bazaar.</li>

<li>
Introduce a new library osgEnv/osgShapes, which adds support for creating
shapes and environmental effects such as stars, planets, cloud layers and
ground planes.</li>

<li>
Integrate unit tests for all classes, and develop a test suite.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Books, tutorials and demonstrations</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Don Burns and Robert Osfield to write the OpenSceneGraph book!</li>

<li>
Development of tutorials to published as part of the distribution and on
the bazaar</li>

<li>
Development of technology demonstrations for shows, presentations and training.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Development of commercial add on libraries:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
osgMP - cross platform library for transparently managing mulitpipe and
cluster graphics systems. Similar in concept to OpenGL multipipe SDK, except
cross platform and with support of graphics clusters.</li>

<li>
osgSim - cross platform library for the visual simulation market with support for light points and small target anti-aliasing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Professional services</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Set up a support contract and support systems for confidential, email,
phone and onsite support.</li>

<li>
Set up the Open Scene Graph Professional License (OSGPL) which is conventional
proprietary license that allows companies to distribute projects that do
not comply with the terms of the LGPL, such as turn key systems.</li>

<li>
Develop training courses.</li>
</ul>

training and consultancy services contact Robert Osfield at <a href="mailto:robert@openscenegraph.com">robert@openscenegraph.com</a>
