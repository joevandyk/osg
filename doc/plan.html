<h2>
<u>Plans for future developments</u></h2>
Now we have reached the beta phase (0.9.x) of OpenScenegGraph project,
and are now working towards the full 1.0 release, with a likely 
release date in second half of 2003.

<h3>
Future work include:</h3>

<ul>

<li>
StateSet composite structure for managing multi-pass effects and alternate rendering implemations.  
This will allow one to manage the use of extensions and provide effecient fallback rendering paths.</li>

<li>
Clean up the API for managing multi-stage and multi-pass rendering within
the scene graph.</li>

<li>
Support for clustering in Open Producer and osgProducer.</li>

<li>
Enhance osgDB and plugins to allow them to be used with alternate input streams.  Add support for native binary 
file format for rapid loading and saving of scene graphs.
</li>

<li>
Development of virtual texture support for rendering in real-time massive images, such as whole earth textures.</li>

<li>
Introduce a new library osgEnvironment, which adds support for creating
shapes and environmental effects such as stars, planets, cloud layers, oceans and
ground planes.</li>

<li>
Integrate unit tests for all classes, using the osgUtx Unit Test Framework.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Books, tutorials and demonstrations</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Don Burns and Robert Osfield to write the OpenSceneGraph book!</li>

<li>
Development of tutorials to published as part of the distribution and on
the bazaar</li>

<li>
Development of technology demonstrations for shows, presentations and training.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Professional services</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Set up a support contract and support systems for confidential, email,
phone and onsite support.</li>

<li>
Set up the Open Scene Graph Professional License (OSGPL) which is conventional
proprietary license that allows companies to distribute projects that do
not comply with the terms of the LGPL, such as turn key systems.</li>

<li>
Develop training courses.</li>
</ul>
