<h2><u>Plans for future developments</u></h2>

<p>
The plan for the next release after 0.8.45 is to from alpha (all 0.8 series version) to beta for the next release,
at this point will bump the version number up to 0.9.0 and all subsequent 0.9 releases will be beta, uptill the
release of 1.0.  The current goal is to move to beta in early summer, with 1.0 in late summer, with SIGGRAPH
being a possibility.
</p>

<h3>Features planed for the next release (0.9.0) include:</h3>
<ul>

<li>
New osg::Geometry drawable to deprecate osg::GeoSet, the new Geometry class
will support multiple text coords, use std::vector<> for easy management of
attributes.and support gl extensions to provide greater polygon performance.
</li>
<li>
Multi-texturing support in osg::Texture. osg::TexMat, osg::TexGen.
</li>
<li>
Multi-pass fallback for when multi-texturing is not supported.
</li>
<li>
Clean up the API for managing multi-stage and multi-pass rendering within the scene graph.
</li>
<li>
Replace osgGLUT with a cleaner windowing API for the demos, move osgGLUT
out of the distribution and into the bazaar.
</li>
<li>
Introduce a new library osgGA, which acts as GUI abstraction layer, move the
current osgUtil camera manipulators into osgGA.</li>
<li>
Introduce a new library osgEnv/osgShapes, which adds support for creating shapes and
environmental effects such as stars, planats, cloud layers and ground planes.
</li>
<li>
Integrate unit tests for all classes, and develop a test suite.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Books, tutorials and demostrations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Don Burns and Robert Osfield to write the OpenSceneGraph book!</li>
<li>
Development of tutorials to published as part of the distribution and on the bazaar</li>
<li>
Development of technoglogy demonstrations for shows, presentations and training.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development of commerical add on libraries:</h3>
<ul>

<li>
osgMP - cross platfrom library for transparently managing mulitpipe and
cluster graphics systems. Similar in concept to OpenGL multipipe SDK, except cross
platform and with support of graphics clusters.
</li>
<li>
osgLP - cross platform libary for support for light points.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Professional services</h3>
<ul>

<li>
Set up a support contract and support systems for confidential,
email, phone and onsite support.</li>
<li>
Set up the Open Scene Graph Professional License (OSGPL) which is
conventional propriatary license.that allows companies to distribute
projects that do not comply wiht the terms of the LGPL, such as turn
key systems.</li>
<li>
Develop training courses.</li>
</ul>

services contact Robert Osfield at <a href="mailto:robert@openscenegraph.com">robert@openscenegraph.com</a> or
