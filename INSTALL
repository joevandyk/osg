The following is a very basic intro of how to get the OSG going under Linux,
FreeBSD, IRIX, Windows and Mac.  Each intro mentions OpenSceneGraph-Data, it is
recommended that you also download it alongside this source distribution.

The scene graph depends upon Standard C++, STL and OpenGL so you need a C++ 
compiler up to the task and OpenGL or Mesa installed. The viewer depends upon
GLUT which you'll need to download and install from the GLUT website.  The
OSG has it own native ascii file format, and .rgb image reader inbuilt which
allows you read the example data with any dependencies other than C++, STL and
OpenGL.

The OSG also has a set of plug-ins which support non-native 3d database and 
image formats, several have no dependencies on external libraries (flt,3ds,obj,
lwo,dw, tga & pic), while others (pfb,jpeg,gif,tiff) require other libraries 
to be installed to compile them.  If you don't already have them installed then
don't worry, you'll still be able to use the OSG.  The core osg library and
viewer has been designed to load the plug-ins at run-time only  and if they 
are required to load a specific data set. If you don't need them for your 
datasets then it won't matter that you haven't been able to compile 
all the plug-ins. A full list of dependencies and where to download the 
required libraries are listed in the index.html.

If you're coming across the OSG for the first time and want to get started 
quickly, go right ahead and follow the compilation instructions.  You can 
always later download the libraries which the plug-ins require if you 
eventually need them.

If you haven't already checked it out, for a list of distribution contents,
contacts and links to documentation check out index.html.


Environmental settings under Unix
---------------------------------

    These enviromental settings are useful to help develop with an
    entirely local copy of the osg.  However, once you've done a
    make install you can make do without all of these, although
    OSGFILEPATH is still useful as the osgDB library uses it for
    picking locating datafiles.

    Add the following to your .cshrc :

        setenv OSGHOME <location of OSG root>
        setenv OSGDATA <location of OSG data root>
        setenv OSGFILEPATH ./:${OSGDATA}:${OSGDATA}/Images:
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${OSGHOME}/lib
        setenv PATH ${PATH}:${OSGHOME}/bin

    Or the following if you're using a sh compatible shell :

        export OSGHOME=<location of OSG root>
        export OSGDATA=<location of OSG data root>
        export OSGFILEPATH=./:${OSGDATA}:${OSGDATA}/Images:
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${OSGHOME}/lib
        export PATH=${PATH}:${OSGHOME}/bin
        
    note: under IRIX you'll need to use LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH instead
    of LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 

Compiling under Linux
---------------------

    To compile, from the OSG root directory, type:

        make
        
    Note, make should automatically detect linux and copy the 
    Make/makerules.linux and Make/makedefs.linux over the 
    default Make/makerules and Make/makedefs.  If autodetection
    does not work type 'make linux'.

    And if you wish to install the OSG to /usr/include/ &
    /usr/lib then su root, and type:
    
        make install
        
          or
          
        make instlinks
         
    To get full details of make options, type:
    
        make help


Compiling under FreeBSD
-----------------------

   To compile, from the OSG root directory, type :

        make freebsd

    And if you wish to install the OSG to /usr/include/ &
    /usr/lib then su root, and type:
    
        make install
        
          or
          
        make instlinks
         
    To get full details of make options, type:
    
        make help


Compiling under IRIX
--------------------

    When setting up environmental variables, specified above,
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH should of course be replaced by LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH.
    
    Since the OSG uses Standard C++ features such as STL it is important
    to have an up to date version of the MIPSPro compilers. The library
    has been tested under MIPSPro7.3 & MIPSPro7.2.1, and *may* compile
    under previous versions but has yet to be tested.  It is recommended
    to use MIPSPro7.3.1.1m.
    
    When compiling with MIPSPro7.2.1 you will need to use STLport for its
    proper implementation of Standard C++ iostreams which are missing 
    from compiler own implementation.  See the bottom of this file for
    further information on STLport.

    To compile, from the OSG root directory, type :

        make

    Note, make should automatically detect IRIX and copy the 
    Make/makerules.irix.std and Make/makedefs.irix.std over the 
    default Make/makerules and Make/makedefs.  If autodetection
    does not work type 'make irix' for MIPSPro7.3 or 'make irix.old'
    for MIPSPro7.2.1 and before.

    And if you wish to install the OSG to /usr/include/ &
    /usr/lib then su root, and type:
    
        make install
        
          or
          
        make instlinks
         
    To get full details of make options, type:
    
        make help


Compiling under Windows
-----------------------

    The Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 workspace file is VisualStudio.dsw located
    in the VisualStudio\ below the OSG this root directory.  The OSG will 
    compile with the basic VisualC++6.0, but its recommended that you use 
    Service Pack 4 to fix MS compiler bugs which affect the OSG.  Even
    Service Pack 4 does not completely fix MSVC bugs associated with STL, so
    it is recommended that you also use STLPort which can be downloaded
    from http://www.stlport.org since they actually know how to write a
    STL library and have done a rather good job at it.  Notes on using
    STLport at the bottom of this file.
    
    The OSG is composed of a number of libraries and executables, to get 
    running you'll need at least to compile osg,osgUtil,osgDB,osgGLUT,
    dot_osg and sgv.  The rest of the libraries and executables are
    optional and can be compiled if you need them.  It may well be simplest
    to do a batch build of all the libraries and executables in the
    distribution, some of the plug-ins which support non native file
    formats may not compile due to dependencies on other libraries (such
    as libpng), you can ignore these compilation errors unless you need
    to load the related file types.  
    
    To execute the viewer the file path for the .dll's and .exe, both compiled
    into the OSG's bin directory, need to be setup, such as by adding the PATH
    to your autoexec.bat, its also useful to add the OSGFILEPATH to your
    autoexec.bat to help the location of datafiles. For example :
    
    SET OSGFILEPATH=D:\OpenSceneGraph-Data;D:\OpenSceneGraph-Data\Images
    SET PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND;C:\Oglsdk\lib;D:\osg-0.8.40\bin;

    To help compilation of the image reader plugins, various image libraries
    have been zipped up for your convienice, your find these on the OSG
    release download directory.


Compiling under MacOS 9
-----------------------

    The Microwerks Codewarrior workspace files can be found under the
    Microwerks directory.  Further details to be fleshed out since
    Mac port is in its early stages and is not uptodate with the
    current release.  To get it compiling you will have to use these
    Codewarrior files as a starting place.  If you get it running and
    have time to maintian the port please email robert@openscenegraph.org.


Compiling under MacOS X (instructions written by Phil Atkin)
------------------------------------------------------------

    For anyone who's ever used a Unix box for development it really is so simple
    it's insane. 

    You need to have installed the Developer tools from the CD that comes for
    free with OS X. This gives you compilers, headers, frameworks - stuff like
    GLUT and Carbon for developers.

    Everything is done command-line, so you need to get to the underlying OS
    rather than the Aqua gloss. The Mac comes with an app in
    Applications/Utilities called Terminal - open up any Finder window (e.g
    double-click on your hard disk icon), click on the Applications icon at the
    top right of the window, then click on the Utilities folder to get access to
    all the grubby apps which give away the real OS roots underneath the shiny
    paintwork. Anyone developing will need Terminal so much they should put it
    in their Dock. You do that by grabbing the icon of the app in the Utilities
    folder and dragging it to the bottom of your screen, at which point the
    other app icons in the Dock slide away to leave a gap which when you release
    the mouse button leaves Terminal permanently available, just a mouse click
    away on your desktop.  When you start Terminal it brings you up a csh
    running under Darwin (which is the BSD-with-knobs-on that underlies OS X),
    and does a cd to ~ (otherwise /Users/username of whoever you are logged in
    as, as far as the Finder in OS X is concerned you are in the Users/username
    folder of the harddisk the machine booted from).

    Then you are in Unix land, and it's all very familiar.

    You will need a .cshrc file with $OSGHOME (as in your instructions), and
    this is a filename that the Mac won't let you see from the Finder or in fact
    generate from an app, so I used vi to create that. Then I just went

    cd $OSGHOME 
    make clean
    make macosx

    And it sounds too good to be true but it is that simple. It's worth doing
    some editing on the Makefiles in the Plugins and Demos directories so that
    it only tries to build a subset, otherwise the developer will have to dig
    out the support projects like jpeg etc. I have only built up to now sgv,
    hangglide, osgcube, osgreflect, osgviews and in the Plugins have built osg
    rgb 3ds and a couple others - will check and get back to you.

    Tricky bit - 
    Installing the libdl.a is more trouble, as you have to enable the root
    account on the machine, which by default is switched off as the machines
    ship for security reasons. Rather than typing in and risking error through
    paraphrase, here is a link to a site which tells you how to do this -

    http://www.macos.utah.edu/Documentation/macosx/security/enablerootuser.html

    Or alternately 

    http://www.thinkmacintosh.com/osxfaq.html


    One you have a root account enabled, you have to su root you cd to the
    directory which the Fink installer generates, and it puts libdl.a and the
    associated .h files in sensible system places so the compiler just finds
    them. 

    There is one oddball problem - if you rely on Path to find the resulting
    executables, a weird Core Graphics error occurs - so even though I set up my
    path to include $(OSGHOME)/bin, and when I cd to $OSGHOME and type for
    example hangglide, the application starts fine (so it is in the path), but
    at the point it tries to use GLUT to open a window it falls over with a CGS
    error (which is I think Core Graphics System). If you explicitly go
    bin/hangglide it works fine. Weird, it may be an OS X 10.04 issue which is
    gone in 10.1 or it may be a weirdy in the Mac GLUT implementation, but
    forewarned is forearmed.

Running the demos
-----------------

    To run the viewer demo type (you made need to type rehash first under Unix) :

        sgv dumptruck.osg
        sgv cow.osg
        sgv e-s-bike.osg

        sgv lz.rgb

        sgv Spinnercar.flt
        sgv Alley.3ds
        sgv town_ogl_pfi.pfb

    Other run other demos type
    
        osgcube

          or

        hangglide
        hangglide master.flt

          or

        osgreflect cow.osg
    
          or

        osgconv Alley.3ds Alley.osg

          or

        osgtexture lz.rgb tree.rgb          

          or
          
        osgimpostor cow.osg

          or
          
        osgviews glider.osg
          

    (Note: the file is picked up by checking the directories pointed to
    by $OSGFILEPATH)


Plug-in dependencies
--------------------

    You may have compile errors if you don't have all the required libraries,
    especially for the plugins.  As long as the core libraries osg, osgUtl,
    osgGLUT and sgv have compiled you won't have any problems running the osg 
    itself but may not be able to use some non-native data formats. To get 
    the problematic plugins working you may need to download support libraries 
    such as libtiff, libjpeg etc.  For further details see index.html.

Using STLport under Windows
---------------------------

    The OSG has been tested under Windows with STLport-4.5, which allows
    the users to configure the type of STL support required for STLport
    itself.  The key configuration that the OSG needs to do is to enable
    the wrapping of MS's own iostreams, than using STLport's own 
    implementation.  The later is not required because this has not be
    problematic under Windows, it is only the container classes and 
    algorithms that need replacing (thanks to MS's utterly hopeless
    implementation of these). Using the iostream wrappping option means
    the STLport can just be used on your include path, there is no need to
    compile STLport itself, or link into any special libraries.

    To configure STLport simply comment IN (its commented out by default),
    the follwing line from STLport-4.5/stlport/stl_user_config.h so it
    should look:
    
        # define   _STLP_NO_OWN_IOSTREAMS	1
    
    Then configure the includes path in Visual Studio to pick up on STLport:
    
        Select the "Tools" menu.
        Select "Options"
        In the Options dialog, select the "Directories" tab
        Under the "include" option, add the path to STLport4.5, something like:
            D:/STLport4.5/stlport
        Then press the up array to move the entry all the way to the top of the
        list, thus overriding MS's own STL implementations.    

STLport under IRIX with MipsPro7.2
----------------------------------

    This hasn't been tried yet, but STLport should allow the OSG to compile
    with the old MipsPro7.2 compilers which don't have their own StandardC++
    iostreams implementation (they only have iostrean.h etc).  Since the
    OSG now only links to the StandardC++ version, STLport should be able
    to provide the StandardC++ iostreams for us. You may need to modify 
    include paths set up in Make/makedefs.irix.nonstd. The default option 
    of using STLport own iostreams is required, which is in contrast to 
    the situation under Windows as outlined above.  Let us know how you
    get on.
