Welcome to the Open Scene Graph (OSG).

For compiling the OSG under all platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, IRIX, Windows
and Mac) please read INSTALL.

For general documentation, distribution contents, and plugin 
dependancies please read index.html in your prefered browser.
index.html also has links to INSTALL, making it easier for Windows 
users which might find the lack of file extensions on text files awkward.
