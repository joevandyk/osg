	  user data support

	* From John Vidar Larring, initial cut of .ive support for
	  ShapeAttributeList user data

2008-09-01 11:09 +0000 [r8815]  robert:

	* Added call to free in setValue methods to prevent potential
	  memory leak

	* From Mathias Froehilch,"Current include/osgSim/ShapeAttribute
	  also misses string.h include because of strdup. Attached is the
	  changed file."

2008-09-01 10:22 +0000 [r8811]  robert:

	* From He Sicong, "I found a bug here in VERTICAL_SPLIT stereo
	  type: The vertical separation not actually displayed as it is
	  set. So some display the up and down stereo images style will not
	  be correct. Someone may forget to change the "Horizontal" to
	  "Vertical" after copying and pasting the code from above
	  HORIZONTAL_SPLIT code segment. I've attached the file. By
	  replacing the incorrect "Horizontal" to "Vertical", the bug is
	  gone. "

	* Removed std:: from in front of strcmp and added a string.h

2008-09-01 10:06 +0000 [r8809]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Most recent changes to
	  CameraPathEventHandler change path writing method. Now control
	  points are written on the fly. But default stream precision is
	  not adjusted as it used to and remains set to 6 digits (at least
	  with VS 2008) so larger coordinates like positions on Earth
	  Ellipsoid loose lots of fidelity. This patch fixes this issue. "

2008-09-01 09:57 +0000 [r8808]  robert:

	* Build fixes for Windows

	  filename when reading and writing files.

2008-08-28 09:43 +0000 [r8804]  robert:

2008-08-26 08:41 +0000 [r8797]  robert:

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, attached is a small fix for a mismatched
	  function signature

2008-08-25 16:44 +0000 [r8795-8796]  robert:

	* Updated version number for 2.7.1 release, and added
	  OSG_FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL Cmake option
	  that enables the occlusion query workaround for an OpenGL driver
	  crash

	* From Doug McCorkle, via Paul Martz who writes : "Summary: Some
	  platforms/configurations cause application crashes if the
	  occlusion query result is not ready for retrieval when the app
	  tries to retrieve it. This fix adds an application-level wait
	  loop to ensure the result is ready for retrieval. This code is
	  not compiled by default; add "-D
	  FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to get this code.
	  Full, gory details, to the best of my recollection: The
	  conditions under which we encountered this issue are as follows:
	  64-bit processor, Mac/Linux OS, multiple NVIDIA GPUs, multiple
	  concurrent draw threads, VRJuggler/SceneView-based viewer, and a
	  scene graph containing OcclusionQueryNodes. Todd wrote a small
	  test program that produces an almost instant crash in this
	  environment. We verified the crash does not occur in a similar
	  environment with a 32-bit processor, but we have not yet tested
	  on Windows and have not yet tested with osgViewer. The OpenGL
	  spec states clearly that, if an occlusion query result is not yet
	  ready, an app can go ahead and attempt to retrieve it, and OpenGL
	  will simply block until the result is ready. Indeed, this is how
	  OcclusionQueryNode is written, and this has worked fine on
	  several platforms and configurations until Todd's test program.
	  By trial and error and dumb luck, we were able to workaround the
	  crash by inserting a wait loop that forces the app to only
	  retrieve the query after OpenGL says it is available. As this
	  should not be required (OpenGL should do this implicitly, and
	  more efficiently), the wait loop code is not compiled by default.
	  Developers requiring this work around must explicitly add "-D
	  FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to the compile
	  options to include the wait loop."

2008-08-25 15:57 +0000 [r8794]  robert:

	* From Liang Aibin, added support for : osgFX::Effect
	  osgFX::AnisotropicLighting osgFX::BumpMapping osgFX::Cartoon

	  closed. Also add a missing close of the movie file.

2008-08-25 15:03 +0000 [r8791]  robert:

	  OpenSceneGraph-2.6.

2008-08-25 14:59 +0000 [r8790]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-08-18 11:21 +0000 [r8770]  robert:

	* From Sergey Leontyev, "1. In StyleManager when applying styles to
	  a Label element the code below runs in a infinite loop. The
	  reason for this is that nothing increments the Reader "r" in the
	  case when applying a style to label, so I advance the reader when
	  no match was found. ( To replicate the error apply style to any
	  label) replaced this: while(!r.eof())
	  if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r)) inc = true; with this:
	  while(!r.eof()) { if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r)) inc =
	  true; else r.advanceOverCurrentFieldOrBlock(); } I tested it and
	  it works well for me, I did not find any problems with it. 2.
	  Added style support for Canvas element, event though there is no
	  styles to apply yet. It is usefull for someone who inherits from
	  Canvas class to develop another element. If applyStyle(Canvas)
	  does not exist there is no way to apply style to the element that
	  inherited from Canvas element. Added virtual bool
	  applyStyle(Canvas). and in added call to apply style if the
	  Object is of type Canvas:
	  StyleManager::_applyStyleToObject(osg::Object* obj, const
	  std::string& style) { ... else
	  if(!std::string("Canvas").compare(c)) return
	  _coerceAndApply<Canvas>(obj,style,c); "

2008-08-18 11:17 +0000 [r8769]  robert:

	* Ran fixtabs to enforce four space tabs

2008-08-18 11:00 +0000 [r8768]  robert:

	* From Erik van Dekker, "I made several modifications: * The cause
	  of my errors was that my OSG source directory path contains
	  spaces. To fix this issue I wrapped all paths with quotes, as
	  stated in doxygen documentation. * I also received some warning
	  messages about deprecated doxygen settings, which I fixed by
	  updating the doxygen file, i.e. running \u2018doxygen \u2013u
	  doxygen.cmake\u2018. By running this command deprecated doxygen
	  options are removed, some option comments have changed and quite
	  some options have been added (I kept their default settings
	  unless mentioned). * I was surprised to find that the doxygen
	  OUTPUT_DIRECTORY was set to
	  \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_SOURCE_DIR}/doc\u201d, which does not seem
	  appropriate for out of source builds; I changed this to
	  \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_BINARY_DIR}/doc\u201d. (On the other hand,
	  maybe a cmake selectable option should be given to the user?) *
	  Fixed two warnings I received about unexpected
	  end-of-list-markers in \u2018osg\AnimationPath and
	  \u2018osgUtil\CullVisitor due to excess trailing points in
	  comments. * Fixed a warning in osgWidget\StyleInterface due to an
	  #include directive (strangely) placed inside a namespace. * Fixed
	  a warning in osg\Camera due to the META_Object macro that
	  confused doxygen. Adding a semi-colon fixed this. * Removed
	  auto_Mainpage from the INCLUDE option, because I am positive that
	  this file does not belong there; It never generated useful
	  documentation anyway. * I added the OSG version number
	  environment variable to the PROJECT_NUMBER option so that the
	  version number is now shown on the main page of generated
	  documentation (e.g. index.html). * Changed option FULL_PATH_NAMES
	  to YES, but made sure STRIP_FROM_PATH stripped the absolute path
	  until the include dir. This fixed an issue that created mangled
	  names for identical filenames in different directories. E.g.
	  osg/Export and osgDB/Export are now correctly named. * Changed
	  option SHOW_DIRECTORIES to yes, which is a case of preference I
	  guess. "

2008-08-18 10:47 +0000 [r8767]  robert:

	* Removed todo entry

2008-08-17 16:52 +0000 [r8766]  robert:

	* From Maceij Krol, "I have implement frame based expiration of
	  PagedLOD children. New attribute DatabasePager::_expiryFrames
	  sets number of frames a PagedLOD child is kept in memory. The
	  attribute is set with DatabasePager::setExpiryFrames method or
	  OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES environmental variable. New attribute
	  PagedLOD::PerRangeData::_ frameNumber contains frame number of
	  last cull traversal. Children of PagedLOD are expired when time
	  _AND_ number of frames since last cull traversal exceed
	  OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY _AND_ OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES respectively. By default
	  OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 1 which means that nodes from last
	  cull/rendering traversal will not be expired even if last cull
	  time exceeds OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY. Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 0
	  revokes previous behaviour of PagedLOD. Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES
	  > 0 fixes problems of children reloading in lazy rendering
	  applications. Required behaviour is achieved by manipulating
	  OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY and OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES together. Two interface
	  changes are made: DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(double
	  currentFrameTime) is replaced by
	  DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(const osg::FrameStamp
	  &frameStamp). The previous method is in #if 0 clause in the
	  header file. Robert, decide if You want to include it.
	  PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double expiryTime, NodeList
	  &removedChildren) is deprecated (warning is printed), when
	  subclassing use PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double
	  expiryTime, int expiryFrame, NodeList &removedChildren) instead.
	  "

2008-08-17 16:45 +0000 [r8765]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, "I've got a few machines that OSG
	  incorrectly believes support FRAME_BUFFER_OBJECTS so I am
	  manually trying to set the renderTargetImplementation to
	  PIXEL_BUFFER or PIXEL_BUFFER_RTT. I noticed that this call wasn't
	  setting the camera's overlay data properly because the
	  setRenderTargetImplementation simply calls init() which only does
	  anything for OBJECT_DEPENDENT_WITH_ORTHOGRAPHIC_OVERLAY. Any
	  subsequent calls to getOverlayData will simply return the cached
	  OverlayData instead of setting it up. My fix updates the camera's
	  render target implementation for all OverlayData objects in the
	  OverlayDataMap."

2008-08-15 17:35 +0000 [r8763-8764]  robert:

	* From Paul Palumbo, "Fixes a typo in coverage antialiasing code...
	  Without this fix, get incorrect antialiasing results. "

	* From Jutta Sauer, "We added a raise window method to
	  GraphicsWindow. And added two implementations for Win32 and X11.
	  "

2008-08-15 17:26 +0000 [r8761-8762]  robert:

	* Updated version numbers in prep for next dev release

	* From Frashid Larshkari, "I modified the vertical/horizontal
	  interlace stereo modes so that they use the osg::State::applyMode
	  for enabling/disabling certain while rendering the stencil mask.
	  Previously some of these calls were overriding the scene graph
	  states because the global state was not aware of this change. "

2008-08-15 17:18 +0000 [r8760]  robert:

	* Added support for geometry shader attributes

2008-08-15 16:43 +0000 [r8759]  robert:

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "I added the osg::Program parameters
	  support for the osg plug'in. Now we could correctly configure
	  geometry shaders in osg files." Notes from Robert Osfield,
	  renamed the names of the parameters to be less GL centric and
	  more human readable.

2008-08-15 16:21 +0000 [r8758]  robert:

	* Changed osg::ImageSequence::set/getDuration to set/getLength() to

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Changes attached so that the
	  CaptureOperation is passed in the constructor of the
	  ScreenCaptureHandler (default 0 = default CaptureOperation). This
	  way, you can do: viewer.addEventHandler(new
	  osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler( new
	  osgViewer::WriteToFileCaptureOperation("filename", "jpg"))); and
	  the filename will be what you want. The
	  WriteToFileCaptureOperation will add the context ID and the file
	  number (if in SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER mode) to the file name. (The
	  attached also clarifies some notify messages, and corrects the
	  comment when adding the handler in osgviewer.cpp) I also
	  remembered, the current architecture could allow a different
	  CaptureOperation for each context, but currently the API only
	  allows setting one CaptureOperation for all contexts. This could
	  be improved if need be. "

	* Updated ChangeLog for dev release

2008-07-12 12:00 +0000 [r8570]  robert:

	* From Doug McCorkle, "Attached is patch that corrects/improves the
	  following issues with the OBJ loader: 1. Added options to control
	  wether the osgUtil::Tessellator or osgUtil::TriStripVisitor are
	  run. By default they still run just as before. 2. Added support
	  for the Emissive material. The data was being read from the mtl
	  file but was never being applied to the model. 3. This is the
	  main bug addressed, when a model is read in with an alpha value
	  specified like: newmtl Material__8 Ns 24 d 0.33 illum 2 Kd 0.204
	  0.204 0.204 Ks 0 0 0 Ka 0.153 0.153 0.153 where the alpha value
	  is d. The loader would then overwrite the alpha value when
	  reading the diffuse, specular, and ambient colors. I have changed
	  all the material color readers to only set the values they read
	  and to use the default colors specified in the constructor of the
	  obj class. With these changes, the obj reader now handles opacity
	  correctly if the alpha value is specified before the material
	  colo"

2008-07-11 19:43 +0000 [r8566]  robert:

	* From Christophe Loustaunau, "For our application, we need to
	  write tiff file in floats. I have change a little bit the
	  readerWritterTiff : It check the data type of the image (
	  img.getDataType() ) and if it's GL_FLOAT :It save the tiff with
	  float values. Otherwise it does the same thing as before."

2008-07-11 19:23 +0000 [r8565]  robert:

	* From Liang Aibin, " In lastest svn version of OSG, the .ive
	  plugin missing osg::Light, it does not process I/O for

	  DataInputStream.cpp, I add support code in
	  DataInputStream::readStateAttribute for osg::Light. 3. In
	  DataOutputStream.cpp, I add support code in
	  DataOutputStream::writeStateAttribute for osg::Light. "

	* From Joakim Simmonson, "Opcodes.h: * Added INVALID_OP as -1 in
	  the Opcodes enum. Note that INVALID_OP is not an actual opcode
	  defined in the OpenFlight format. The purpose of INVALID_OP is to
	  mark an opcode variable as invalid or uninitialized.
	  ReaderWriterFLT.cpp: * The header node is returned if it exists,
	  even if the file does not contain a node hierarchy. The old
	  behaviour returned a ERROR_IN_READING_FILE error. * Changed
	  opcodes initialized to -1 to the new enum value INVALID_OP."

	  support into osgDB::Registry/osgTerrain so that newly created
	  subgraphs can have KdTree built on all osg::Geometry
	  automatically on load/creation.

2008-07-04 11:51 +0000 [r8534]  robert:

	* Moved vertex indicies method into a single block with deprecated
	  doc lines

2008-07-03 17:18 +0000 [r8533]  robert:

	* Introduced bounding boxes to KDLeaf and KDNode structs

2008-07-03 15:49 +0000 [r8532]  robert:

	* Added new data structure + build algorithm that places triangles
	  into leaves without being shared, but with varying the boundaries
	  of leaves so that they may overlap.

2008-07-03 15:01 +0000 [r8530-8531]  robert:

	* From Mario Valle, "xed the following warning on Linux 64 bits
	  Athlon:
	  /users/mvalle/OSG/OpenSceneGraph/src/osg/BufferObject.cpp: In
	  member function `virtual void
	  osg::ElementBufferObject::compileBuffer(osg::State&) const':
	  /users/mvalle/OSG/OpenSceneGraph/src/osg/BufferObject.cpp:600:
	  warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size"

	* From Mario Valle, removed extraneous spaces

2008-07-03 11:23 +0000 [r8528-8529]  robert:

	* Added header guards

	* Refactored example so that the example will be able to run
	  different kdtree data strucutres/algorithms.

2008-07-03 11:07 +0000 [r8527]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "The check for Leopard to build 4-way
	  binaries by default was broken. Here is an updated CMakeLists.txt
	  file to fix the problem."

2008-07-03 10:24 +0000 [r8526]  robert:

	* Implement an experiemental triangle kdtree building support

2008-07-03 10:03 +0000 [r8525]  robert:

	* Set the DataVariance on FadeText to DYNAMIC to reflect their
	  nature

2008-07-02 10:00 +0000 [r8524]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-07-02 09:25 +0000 [r8523]  robert:

	* Introduced support for UNSCPECIFIED and STATIC DataVariance of
	  StateSet/Textures

2008-07-01 19:04 +0000 [r8522]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, "There is a problem reading bmp files
	  containing a colour palette, due to an incorrect scan line length
	  calculation. Attached is a fix, and a little bmp file which
	  demonstrates the problem."

2008-07-01 18:37 +0000 [r8521]  robert:

	* From Lilin Xiong, "I change ive plugin a little for osgText
	  inout, so the ive plugin supports backdrop setting, and Text3D,
	  FadeText inout : 1. in DataInputStream.cpp, add 1286--1293 lines;
	  2. in Text.cpp, add some code for text's Backdrop setting; 3. in
	  IveVersion.h, add line 39, increase the VERSION to
	  VERSION_028(line 41) 4. in ReadWrite.h, add line 146,147 5. add
	  file FadeText.h, FadeText.cpp, Text3D.h, Text3D.cpp."

2008-07-01 13:56 +0000 [r8520]  robert:

	* Added Vec3Array arrange pointer to avoid dynamic cast

2008-07-01 09:40 +0000 [r8519]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "It appears not to be sufficient to set a
	  cmake variable to get a define in such a config file. Instead set
	  that variable to 1. Also included a small compile fix, that
	  appears to be required than ..."

2008-06-30 16:53 +0000 [r8518]  robert:

	* Added guards against FBO not being supported/setup

2008-06-29 13:41 +0000 [r8514]  robert:

	* Updated README date for 2.5.3 dev release

2008-06-29 12:22 +0000 [r8513]  robert:

	* Changed the Optimizer::StateVisitor so that it can individually
	  decide whether to optimize away duplicate state with dynamic,
	  static and unspecified DataVarience. By default the code now
	  optimizes away duplicate state with either static and unspecied
	  state, previously it was just handling static state.

2008-06-28 16:59 +0000 [r8512]  robert:

	* Added realize of new graphics contexts to handle new views being
	  added with unrealized windows

2008-06-27 19:40 +0000 [r8511]  robert:

	* Changed back to use an std::vector<> rather than a std::list for
	  RequestQueue to avoid member template problems under Solaris.

2008-06-27 18:59 +0000 [r8510]  robert:

	* Refactored the sort of the requestQueue so that there is single
	  code path for doing the sort.

2008-06-27 16:47 +0000 [r8509]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Update to the configure check for msvc
	  7.1. MemoryBarrier() is used in the implementation, so it should
	  be checked. This in effect disables the faster atomic ops on msvc
	  7.1 and older, even if only the MemoryBarrier() call is missing.
	  But it ensures for the fist cut that it will build everywhere. If
	  somebody cares for msvc 7.1 enough and has one for testing
	  installed, he might provide the apropriate defines to guard that
	  MemoryBarrier() call. I tested that msvc8 32/64bit still passes
	  the configure tests and compiles. "

2008-06-27 12:44 +0000 [r8508]  robert:

	* Simplified the MixinVector class so that it no longer supports
	  custom allocators, instead just uses std::vector<>'s default
	  allocators.

2008-06-27 12:35 +0000 [r8507]  robert:

	* Moved the apply(&) default implementations from the header into
	  the NodeVisitor.cpp, and changed the casts to use static_cast<>.

2008-06-27 11:47 +0000 [r8506]  shuber:

	* from Stephan Huber: updated XCode project

2008-06-27 10:17 +0000 [r8505]  robert:

	* From Andre Normann, "with version 8504, I am not able to compile
	  osgwrappers under Windows, because there are some DLL export
	  macros missing. I fixed it and put the files in the attached zip
	  file. "

2008-06-26 19:51 +0000 [r8504]  robert:

	* Updated authors and osgversion

2008-06-26 19:47 +0000 [r8503]  robert:

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-26 19:21 +0000 [r8502]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-26 18:34 +0000 [r8501]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "The method
	  IntersectionVisitor::apply(osg::PagedLOD&) appears to attempt to
	  identify a "highest res" child of the PagedLOD and only allow
	  intersection on that child. The implementation appears to be
	  flawed in two cases: 1) The "highest res" child is assumed to be
	  the child with index "getNumFileNames()-1" or
	  "getNumChildren()-1". As a result, PagedLODs that do not sort
	  children from furthest to nearest will intersect with the wrong
	  child. (see attached "case1.osg" to reproduce this problem.) 2)
	  The code assumes there is only one highest res child. As a
	  result. PagedLODs with multiple children at the same highest res
	  range can only intersect one of those children. ("case2.osg"
	  demonstrates this issue; you can only pick the quad on the
	  right.) I've attached a modified IntersectionVisitor.cpp that
	  attempts to resolve these issues. It identifies a highest res
	  range based on the range mode, then continues traversal on all
	  valid children corresponding to that range description. Only in
	  the case of a malformed PagedLOD does the code fall back to
	  getting the last child in the list. "

2008-06-26 18:06 +0000 [r8500]  robert:

	* From Morten Haukness, "When cloning effects osg crashes because
	  the copy constructur tries to run av pure virtual method
	  (setUpEmitterAndProgram). The right thing to do when cloning an
	  effect is to run the inherited version og buildEffect and
	  setUpEmitterAndProgram. "

2008-06-26 16:45 +0000 [r8499]  robert:

	* Changed the removeCamera() method so that it now actively calls
	  releaseGLObjects() on all children of a camera that aren't shared
	  with other cameras on that context. This change fixes problems
	  with allocating and deleting views.

2008-06-26 15:06 +0000 [r8498]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, updated CMakeLists.txt to build the
	  Atomic.cpp

2008-06-26 13:09 +0000 [r8496-8497]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowski, added enforcement of CMake 2.6.0 under OSX.

	* From Eric Sokolowski, Cmake support for osgviewerCocoa

2008-06-26 12:08 +0000 [r8495]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, build fixes for various unices

2008-06-26 10:33 +0000 [r8494]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, added do not edit comments to Config.in
	  so that the autogenerated Config files have an appropriate
	  warning notice

2008-06-26 10:27 +0000 [r8493]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froechlich, "Attached is a change to that atomic
	  stuff to move the win32, msvc implementation of the atomic
	  increment and decrement into a implementation file. This way
	  inlining and compiler optimization can no longer happen for these
	  implementations, but it fixes compilation on win32 msvc targets.
	  I expect that this is still faster than with with mutexes. Also
	  the i386 gcc target gets atomic operations with this patch. By
	  using an implementation file we can guarantee that we have the
	  right compiler flags available."

2008-06-23 15:11 +0000 [r8491]  robert:

	* Fixed pedantic warning

2008-06-23 14:51 +0000 [r8490]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "fixed win32/win64 configure check and
	  win32/win64 atomic related compile failures with msvs2005.
	  Attached changes to make win32 really use the atomic stuff. There
	  are pointer typecast problems and some historic alignment
	  restrictions that I just took from a previous similar
	  implementation of mine without looking deep enough. "

2008-06-23 11:14 +0000 [r8489]  robert:

	* From Mathieu Marache, "Suibject: CMakeList ADD_DEFINITION for
	  CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX broken I needed a -DCMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX="d"
	  not a -D"CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX=d". This corrects the build for the
	  CMake 2.4 and 2.6 series The error was in compiling
	  osgDB/Registry.cpp "

2008-06-23 10:18 +0000 [r8488]  robert:

	* Commented out the explict install of the Config files as
	  including these files into the header list allows the normal
	  Cmake install support to install them.

2008-06-23 09:57 +0000 [r8487]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "I have made a number of changes intended
	  to get a few things working better on OSX. However, since I'm
	  still pretty new at Mac development and cmake I'm not entirely
	  certain that the changes I have made are benign on other
	  platforms. I have tested these changes on Leopard with CMake 2.6
	  generating Xcode 3.0 projects, compiling on ppc and i386 for 10.5
	  and 10.4, and on Linux (CentOS) and everything still seems to
	  work ok. Here are the changes I made (against OSG svn as of this
	  afternoon): - Added osgviewerCocoa example to APPLE builds -
	  Fixed corrupt Xcode project generation with CMake 2.6 dealing
	  with ADD_DEFINITIONS and CMake Policy CMP0005 on Leopard -
	  Resolved CMP0006 warning for examples and programs by setting
	  BUNDLE DESTINATION to same as RUNTIME DESTINATION with CMake 2.6
	  - Fixed freetype plugin on Leopard to avoid OpenGL linking
	  problem - Figured out how to use a custom Info.plist included in
	  the project (see osgviewerCocoa application CMakeLists.txt)"

2008-06-23 08:06 +0000 [r8486]  shuber:

	* From Stephan Huber: added missing config files and updated
	  xcode-project

2008-06-21 17:56 +0000 [r8485]  robert:

	* Quietened down debug info

2008-06-21 17:50 +0000 [r8484]  robert:

	* Added support for X11's overrideRedirect functionality

2008-06-21 11:34 +0000 [r8483]  robert:

	* Converted tabs to four spaces

2008-06-20 19:52 +0000 [r8481-8482]  robert:

	* Changed the include/osg/Config and include/OpenThreads/Config
	  references to use the assocaited CMake variable for these headers

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-20 17:32 +0000 [r8480]  robert:

	* From Terry Welsh, added missing MixinVector header

2008-06-20 16:57 +0000 [r8479]  robert:

	* Added OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM cmake option string to allow toggling
	  between X11 and Carbon under OSX.

2008-06-20 15:50 +0000 [r8476-8477]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, moved optional config variables into
	  include/osg/Config file that is automatically created by cmake
	  according to its own settings.

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-20 15:28 +0000 [r8475]  robert:

	* Changed const double* to const Matrix::value_type* to ensure
	  changes in Matrix type don't break the build

2008-06-20 13:16 +0000 [r8474]  robert:

	* From Terry Welsh, new flatten static transforms visitor that
	  duplicates subgraphs that are shared beneath differnt static
	  transforms From Robert Osfield, made a range of changes to
	  Terry's visitor integrating it into osgUtil::Optimizer and
	  changing the code to use a style more like the rest of the OSG.

2008-06-20 11:16 +0000 [r8473]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, made the include of bin directory for
	  include/OpenThreads/Config only used when doing out of source
	  builds

2008-06-20 11:11 +0000 [r8472]  robert:

	* Updated version numbers for dev releases

2008-06-20 10:46 +0000 [r8471]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Fixes a compile of
	  src/osgSim/ShapeAttribute.cpp on suse 10.2."

2008-06-20 09:46 +0000 [r8470]  robert:

	* From Melchior Franz, fixed typo on variable name

2008-06-20 09:42 +0000 [r8469]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, add search path to enable out of source
	  builds to find include/OpenThreads/Config.

2008-06-19 20:42 +0000 [r8468]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-19 20:38 +0000 [r8467]  robert:

	* From Neil Groves, "I have taken the liberty of updating a few
	  files so that there is no longer any derivation from std::vector.
	  I have done this by adding a new file osg/MixinVector and by
	  updating only two others: osg/PrimitiveSet and osg/Array. You
	  will notice that this actually removes what is acknowledged as a
	  \u2018hack\u2019 in osg/PrimitiveSet. With the original code I
	  did manage to find memory leaks with some compiler options on VC
	  8 and 9, as well as Intel compiler. I determined the leak
	  existence by instrumenting the destructor code, and by use of a
	  garbage collector as a leak detector (in a similar manner to the
	  Firefox project). Hence in contrast to what I said originally, it
	  is exhibiting symptoms on at least some platforms. Since I am
	  trying to be a good OSG citizen I got out my editor and started
	  hacking! I have built and tested on Linux (Ubuntu) with GCC 4.x
	  and Windows VC 8 SP1. It appears that nothing is broken, and that
	  I\u2019m using less memory J"

2008-06-19 17:35 +0000 [r8466]  robert:

	* From Mathieu Marache, "submission for inclusion to support mpg
	  and avi files when using the quicktime plugin on windows"

2008-06-19 17:30 +0000 [r8465]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, added support for using
	  OpenThreads::Atomic for thread safe ref/unref.

2008-06-19 14:57 +0000 [r8464]  robert:

	* from Andrew Bettison, LineStipple support for .ive

2008-06-19 14:45 +0000 [r8463]  robert:

	* From Adrian Egli, "Improvements to the PSSM implementation"

2008-06-19 14:35 +0000 [r8462]  robert:

	* From Rudolf Weidemann, "in the OpenFlight format materials can
	  have editable names. In the OSG OpenFlight plugin these names are
	  ignored when reading, and empty strings are written. As we need
	  these names in the OSG scene graph by our application, I changed
	  the plugin code, so the names are now stored in class
	  "osg::Material" (derived from "osg::Object") by
	  material->setName(); (see "PaletteRecords.cpp, line 195) when
	  reading the file, and written to file by dos.writeString(
	  m.Material->getName(), 12 ); (see MaterialPaletteManager.cpp,
	  line 80). As these names otherwise get lost when reading an
	  OpenFlight file and writing it again e.g. by osgconv example.flt
	  converted_example.flt these changes make the plugin more
	  complete. The changes were made to OSG revision 8425, and were
	  tested by osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt comparing the
	  material palettes of both files inside Multigen Creator."

2008-06-19 14:29 +0000 [r8461]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed some problems when setting up
	  CameraNodes that inherit viewport settings in stereo mode. It
	  seems that the SceneView::cull() method will pass the full size
	  viewport to the left/right cullvisitors, instead of the modified
	  stereo viewport. I made quite a few changes to SceneView to fix
	  the issue. The SceneView::cullStage() method will now receive the
	  viewport as an argument, instead of using the global viewport.
	  The SceneView::cull() method will pass the modifed viewport to
	  cullStage when rendering in stereo. There are 2 new private
	  methods computeLeftEyeViewport() and computeRightEyeViewport()
	  that will compute the stereo viewports. I also modified the
	  draw() function so it applies the correct viewport to the
	  prerender stages. These changes are only necessary for
	  horizontal/vertical split stereo."

2008-06-19 14:14 +0000 [r8460]  robert:

	* From Andrew Bettison, "Attached are changes for
	  src/osgPlugins/ive (version 2.4.0) that implement LineStipple
	  read/write support for the ive file format."

2008-06-19 13:49 +0000 [r8459]  robert:

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is a reworked version of the osgviewerWX
	  example. It changes the GraphicsWindowWX to only inherit from
	  osgViewer::GraphicsWindow and adds a standalone widget, called
	  OSGCanvas, that derives from wxGLCanvas. This solves a problem
	  with the GraphicsWindowWX instance being destructed twice (see
	  "Crash in osgviewerWX" of June 12th on osg-users). At program
	  exit, the main frame deletes all of its children widgets and
	  therefore calls GraphicsWindowWX's destructor, bypassing OSG's
	  reference counting. The GraphicsWindowWX instance is then later
	  destructed a second time when the reference held by osg::Camera
	  goes to zero. This bug isn't exposed by the example directly, but
	  if people are going to use the example as a basis (like the
	  poster in the mentioned thread) they very likely will run into
	  this problem. "

2008-06-19 13:28 +0000 [r8458]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers to fix OpenThreads::Atomic build issues.

2008-06-19 12:02 +0000 [r8457]  robert:

	* From Michael Platings, fixed typo error in renderbin assignment

2008-06-19 11:58 +0000 [r8456]  robert:

	* In Program::PerContextProgram changed const Uniform* to
	  osg::ref_ptr<const Uniform*> to avoid the possibility of a
	  uniform being deleted and another being created and assigned at
	  the same address which previously confused the uniform tracking
	  code and introduced a bug.

2008-06-19 11:09 +0000 [r8455]  robert:

	* From Michael Platings and Robert Osfield, added support for
	  controlling, via StateSet::setNestedRenderBin(bool) whether the
	  new RenderBin should be nested with the existing RenderBin, or be
	  nested with the enclosing RenderStage.

2008-06-18 20:27 +0000 [r8453-8454]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Michael Platings, implemented check against max number of
	  supported samples to ensure that the number of samples is safely
	  capped to what the hardware is capable of, avoiding GL errors and
	  graceful fallback

2008-06-18 20:17 +0000 [r8452]  robert:

	* From Liang Aibin: "1. Location:
	  <OSG_SOURCE_ROOT>\src\osgPlugins\osg\Fog.cpp Reason: ".osg"
	  writter plugins output incorrected string for osg::Fog's Mode.
	  How to Fix: Line 138 in Fog.cpp: case(Fog::LINEAR): return

2008-06-18 16:46 +0000 [r8450-8451]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Added a wrapString(const char*) which automatically handles null
	  strings.

2008-06-18 16:28 +0000 [r8449]  robert:

	* Convert string handling to use strdup and free rather then
	  awkward new char[] code paths

2008-06-18 14:21 +0000 [r8448]  robert:

	* Added --fbo-samples value and --color-samples value command line
	  paramters for enabling fbo multisampling

2008-06-18 14:09 +0000 [r8447]  robert:

	* From Michael Platings and Paul Palumbo, multi-sample FBO support

2008-06-18 12:01 +0000 [r8446]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When copying a node that had uniforms
	  on it, the copy constructor of osg::Uniform would not copy the
	  array of the original uniform (either _intArray or _floatArray)
	  because none had been allocated and the copy constructor checks
	  that *both* this's array and rhs's array are valid. I added a
	  call to allocateDataArray() if rhs has (at least) one valid
	  array, which should allocate the right array according to the
	  type. Since the type was copied from rhs, it should create the
	  same array as rhs has, so then it should copy the data in the
	  following lines. "

2008-06-18 11:56 +0000 [r8445]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, "added multi-texture support (alpha/trans
	  images)"

2008-06-18 11:51 +0000 [r8444]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-18 11:13 +0000 [r8443]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, "this submission extends the
	  osgViewer::RecordCameraPathHandler to have an optionally-enabled
	  auto-incrementing filename. default behavior is still the same,
	  but there's one new method to enable autoincrementing filenames."
	  From Robert Osfield, modified the above so that the number
	  increments come after the filename rather than before.

2008-06-18 10:51 +0000 [r8442]  robert:

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "Added support for vrml primitive
	  caching"

2008-06-18 10:46 +0000 [r8441]  robert:

	* From David Callu, "fixed bounding box bug"

2008-06-17 17:43 +0000 [r8440]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, OpenThreads::Atomic support

2008-06-16 20:22 +0000 [r8439]  robert:

	* Added overriding of CullSettings::inheritCullSettings() into
	  osg::Camera to properly inherit the clear colour.

2008-06-16 16:06 +0000 [r8438]  robert:

	* Changed class to struct

2008-06-16 13:20 +0000 [r8437]  robert:

	* Added mutex to serialize access to the trpager

2008-06-16 09:32 +0000 [r8436]  robert:

	* Checking in missing header changes

2008-06-12 16:33 +0000 [r8434]  robert:

	* Refactored the management of the request queues so that the
	  appropraite mutex is locked when DatabaseRequest objects are
	  modified

2008-06-06 19:57 +0000 [r8425]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers, authors and readme for 2.5.2 dev release

2008-06-06 19:41 +0000 [r8424]  robert:

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-06 17:45 +0000 [r8423]  robert:

	* Updated versions for 2.5.2 dev release

2008-06-06 16:45 +0000 [r8422]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "The new osgscreencapture example was
	  being installed to bin instead of to share/OpenSceneGraph/bin,
	  this is because the CMakeLists.txt used SETUP_APPLICATION instead
	  of SETUP_EXAMPLE. Corrected CMakeLists.txt attached. "

2008-06-06 16:41 +0000 [r8421]  robert:

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "fix to reading of DatabasePath
	  property"

2008-06-06 16:28 +0000 [r8420]  robert:

	* From Glenn Waldron, "I'm using an IntersectionVisitor with a
	  PagedLOD database, employing a ReadCallback to allow the
	  intersector to traverse the paged nodes. I discovered that if the
	  visitor is unable (for any reason) to load a subtile via the
	  ReadCallback, the intersection fails. However, I had the
	  requirement to "fall back" on the lower-resolution parent tile
	  and settle for that intersection. This was easy to implement
	  simply by overriding IntersectionVisitor::apply(PagedLOD). My
	  question is: Are there any opinions on whether this should be the
	  default behavior? If it makes sense, I will submit the change; if
	  not, no worries."

2008-06-06 16:25 +0000 [r8419]  robert:

	* From Paul Melis, "Here's an updated include/osgText/Text3D that
	  forces recomputation of the glyph repr when the character depth
	  is updated, also when the rendering mode is set. This caused a
	  Text3D object read from a .osg file to not have the correct
	  depth."

2008-06-06 14:59 +0000 [r8418]  robert:

	* From Mathieu Marache, "I have made the logo plugin work again (a
	  simple copy and paste problem) and added the path of the logo
	  file (if not empty) to the data file path in order to be able to
	  find images relatively."

2008-06-06 14:10 +0000 [r8417]  robert:

	* Cleaned up implementation to only use simple structure

2008-06-06 13:21 +0000 [r8415-8416]  robert:

	* Renamed _rendergraph to _stateGraph to better reflect its
	  function

	* Introduce a lower overhead data structure for leaves.

2008-06-06 10:51 +0000 [r8414]  robert:

	* Added update traversal to run prior to doing kdtree build to make
	  sure that costs in build osgTerrain databases isn't incurred
	  during the build traversal.

2008-06-06 09:08 +0000 [r8413]  robert:

	* Quitened down the release context message

2008-06-06 08:42 +0000 [r8412]  robert:

	* Added OSGDB_EXPORT

2008-06-05 18:52 +0000 [r8411]  robert:

	* Added timing code

2008-06-05 17:28 +0000 [r8410]  robert:

	* Basic implementation of kdtree generation based on vertices

2008-06-05 13:46 +0000 [r8409]  robert:

	* Added accep(Shape&)

2008-06-04 17:59 +0000 [r8408]  robert:

	* Further work on fleshing out basic classes

2008-06-04 16:53 +0000 [r8407]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-04 16:46 +0000 [r8406]  robert:

	* Added support for optionally calling releaseContext at the end of
	  each renderinTraversals() to help with cases where uses are
	  driving multiple contexts from mulitple viewers in a single
	  threaded frame loop.

2008-06-03 17:29 +0000 [r8405]  robert:

	* Fleshed out some basic kd-tree data structures.

2008-06-03 16:13 +0000 [r8404]  robert:

	* First cut of osgkdtree example, this will be used as a base of
	  the development of native kdtree support to help speed up
	  intersection testing.

2008-06-03 15:49 +0000 [r8403]  robert:

	* Added missing updateBlock()

2008-06-03 13:07 +0000 [r8401-8402]  robert:

	* From Mario Valle, fixed warnings

	* Ran merge to get rid of tabs

2008-06-03 11:31 +0000 [r8400]  robert:

	* From Marco Lehmann and Robert Osfield, this fix was implemented
	  by Robert but is based on suggested fix from Marco for fixing a
	  crash due to lack of thread safety in std::ofstream("/dev/null");
	  The fix is to use a custom stream buffer that just discards all
	  data. The implementation is also twice as fast as the old
	  /dev/null based approach.

2008-06-03 11:28 +0000 [r8399]  robert:

	* Added unit test to smoke out a thread issue with using
	  ofstream("/dev/null") inside osg::notify()

2008-06-02 17:34 +0000 [r8398]  robert:

	* Added support for assigning GraphicsContext to individual
	  GUIEventAdapter events, and use of this within osgViewer::View to
	  better track the sources of events.

2008-05-31 08:47 +0000 [r8397]  robert:

	* Changed FIND_PACKAGE(PkgConfig) to INCLUDE(FindPkgConfig
	  OPTIONAL) as per suggestion from Philip Lowman.

2008-05-30 21:23 +0000 [r8395]  robert:

	* Updated authors and version file for 2.5.1 dev release

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-05-30 21:08 +0000 [r8393]  robert:

	* Added version check on FIND_PACKAGE(PkgConfig) to attempt to fix
	  build with older versions of CMake

2008-05-30 20:15 +0000 [r8392]  robert:

	* Added applyMaskAction(CLEAR_COLOR) to Camera::setClearColor() to
	  enable proper inheritance

2008-05-30 17:03 +0000 [r8391]  robert:

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-05-30 16:53 +0000 [r8390]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "This is a fix for the warning we've
	  been discussing on osg-users. CMake 2.6.0 allows quotes to be
	  unescaped in strings in ADD_DEFINITIONS statements, where we had
	  to escape them before (CMake 2.4.x). Setting CMake policy CMP0005
	  to OLD removes the warning for 2.6.0, and the quotes are still
	  escaped, so it still works with 2.4.x. "

2008-05-30 12:59 +0000 [r8389]  robert:

	* From Luc Frauciel, Added support for
	  osgTerrain::ValidDataOperator. From Robert Osfield, added
	  versioning to the above.

2008-05-30 11:44 +0000 [r8387-8388]  robert:

	* Updated packgage number for 2.5.1 developer release

	* Fixed cirular reference in DatabaseRequest

2008-05-29 13:54 +0000 [r8386]  robert:

	* Moved enum to public scope and rebuilt wrappers to fix wrapper
	  build error

2008-05-29 11:45 +0000 [r8385]  robert:

	* Added code to catch erroneous Dof axis settings

2008-05-29 11:13 +0000 [r8384]  robert:

	* Improved the NaN depth detection within CullVisitor and debug
	  output.

2008-05-29 11:09 +0000 [r8383]  robert:

	* Improved the NaN error detection and reporting.

2008-05-28 17:56 +0000 [r8382]  robert:

	* Added catch for NaN depth values

2008-05-28 16:14 +0000 [r8381]  robert:

	* From Wojiech Lewandowski, Workaround for wglMakeCurrent bug in
	  NVidia drivers by calling wglMakeCurrent twice. This bug has been
	  reported to NVidia, confirmed and fixed by NVidia but awaits
	  verifiaction and release if a driver which fixes this bug.

2008-05-28 14:37 +0000 [r8380]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-28 14:11 +0000 [r8379]  robert:

	* From Adrian Egli, improvements to ParallelSplitShadowMap
	  implementation

2008-05-28 13:51 +0000 [r8378]  robert:

	* From Thibault Genessay, "The PNG plugin crashes when you try to
	  read a malformed file (attached is an example). This can happen
	  in circumstances that are not manageable by the OSG itself (e.g.
	  3rd party buggy program) but one would expect the plugin to be
	  able to recover by returning ReadResult::ERROR_IN_READING_FILE.
	  libpng provides two callbacks for warnings and errors - those are
	  currently unused. By default, they point to function that call
	  exit() or something similar (the default error callback never
	  returns). This patch registers the callbacks using libpng's
	  mechanisms, makes the warning callback emit an
	  osg::notify(osg::WARN) message and the error callback throw an
	  error. The reading process is enclosed in a try...catch block.
	  Upon error, the memory is freed and
	  ReadResult::ERROR_IN_READING_FILE is returned. "

2008-05-28 13:45 +0000 [r8377]  robert:

	* From Thibault Genessay, "On Windows, when setting a cursor
	  through osgViewer::GraphicsWindow::setCursor() the new cursor
	  type is recorded but not applied until windows sends another
	  WM_SETCURSOR message. This delays the application of the cursor
	  to the next mouse event. The attached file fixes this by setting
	  the new cursor with a call to ::SetCursor() immediately. "

2008-05-28 13:01 +0000 [r8376]  robert:

	* From Michael Platings, "Yes it's definitely a driver problem - I
	  submitted a bug report to nvidia 6 months ago and the issue is
	  still "in progress". I've given up waiting for them! Platform -
	  various Intel Windows XP SP2 PCs with various nvidia cards
	  including GeForce 8800 GTS and Quadro FX 4500, and various driver
	  versions including the latest WHQL 175.16. I investigated your
	  concerns about glGenerateMipmapEXT being slower than
	  GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS, and for power-of-two textures, to my
	  surprise it is. For a 512*512 texture, glGenerateMipmapEXT takes
	  on average 10ms, while GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS takes on average
	  6ms. Therefore I have modified the code to only use
	  glGenerateMipmapEXT if the texture has a non-power-of-two width
	  or height. I am resubmitting all the files previously submitted
	  (only "Texture.cpp" has significant changes since my previous
	  submission, I've also replaced tabs with spaces in "Texture"). "

2008-05-28 12:49 +0000 [r8375]  robert:

	* From Mathieu Marache, first post: "I had the problem that debug
	  and release version of the plugins had the same name under linux.
	  These minors modification to Registry and the CMake support files
	  enable to have both Release and Debug version of the plugins to
	  coexist and be found by there respective runtimes." follow up
	  post: "I've gone ahead and added a preprocessor directive with
	  the editable CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX. I modified Registry.cpp to take
	  this new preprocessor directive called OSG_DEBUG_POSTFIX while
	  looking for libraries in Debug mode for the windows (msvc) and
	  the linux platforms. MinGW, cygwin and Apple are still left out
	  this proposal." Notes from Robert Osfield, completed the work in
	  change d entries to use OSG_DEBUG_POSTFIX

2008-05-28 11:58 +0000 [r8374]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-28 11:19 +0000 [r8373]  robert:

	* From Michael Platings, "On nvidia cards mipmap generation for
	  non-power-of-two textures with GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS is very
	  slow (over half a second for a 720*576 texture). However,
	  glGenerateMipmapEXT() performs well (16ms for the same texture),
	  so I have modified the attached files to use
	  Texture::generateMipmap() if glGenerateMipmapEXT is supported,
	  instead of enabling & disabling GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS." Notes,
	  from Robert Osfield, I've tested the out of the previous path
	  using GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS and non power of two textures on
	  NVidia 7800GT and Nvidia linux drivers with the image size
	  720x576 and only get compile times of 56ms, so the above half
	  second speed looks to be a driver bug. With Muchael's changes the
	  cost goes done to less than 5ms, so it's certainly an effective
	  change, even given that Michael's poor expereiences with
	  GL_GENERATE_MIP_SGIS do look to be a driver bug.

2008-05-27 20:53 +0000 [r8372]  robert:

	* From Brad Anderegg, "This submission fixes two bugs and helps
	  some performance problems we have been having with txp databases.
	  The first bug is that the terrain tiles will page out to a lower
	  LOD when they are right in front of you. The issue appears to be
	  with the blacklisting heuristic which forces a tile to LOD 1,
	  commenting out the usage of blacklisting with the LOD Nodes fixes
	  our problem. This code change was made to line 29 of
	  TXPPageLOD.cpp. The second bug we were experiencing is that the
	  database reader options never make it through to the archive
	  loader. The use case for us appeared when the FID codes for the
	  terrain were no longer on the materials. As it turns out the
	  archive was being created twice, once by TXPNode and once by the
	  ReaderWriterTXP on getArchive() so the options never actually got
	  set on the archive that was being loaded. The fix is to first
	  create the archive by calling getArchive on the ReaderWriterTXP,
	  which stores it in a map for reference later, and then passing
	  that archive into the TXPNode for it to set its internal member.
	  With this code change we only create one archive (not sure what
	  creating two did) and our options flags get set properly on the
	  database. The changes made are in TXPNode.h line 72 where the
	  TXPArchive is now passed in. In the TXPNode.cpp the
	  loadArchive(TXPArchive*) was changed to have the default behavior
	  if NULL is passed in, if an archive is passed in then it does not
	  load it since all the loading is done in the
	  ReaderWriterTXP::getArchive(). The only other place that
	  loadArchive is called is in TXPIO.cpp where a modification was
	  made to pass in NULL which will have the same behavior as it used
	  to. The last change is the little block of code starting on line
	  57 of ReaderWriterTXP.cpp, this was changed so that it first
	  calls getArchive() which caches the archives in a map does some
	  loading stuff and returns a pointer to it which is then passed in
	  as a parameter to TXPNode::loadArchive(). The performance changes
	  were made to TXPParser.cpp line 163 where we use to
	  osgUtil::Optimizer on the node before passing it off, and on line
	  1456 we changed the geometry to use display lists. These small
	  changes actually made drastic performance increases for us, as
	  much as 1000% on certain laptops. As far as testing goes, we have
	  tested these changes with at least 5 txp databases on a variety
	  of different computers including Mac OS and Linux. The base
	  version used is 2.4."

2008-05-27 17:42 +0000 [r8371]  robert:

	* From Cedric Pinson, "By default it's the normal behaviour, it
	  means it's "d" extension for debug library and executable. But if
	  you want to change that you can. The reason is if you want to
	  build an application that use a library that use openscenegraph
	  you have to build the full chain in debug or in release. On
	  windows you have no choice, but on linux you can link with both
	  version without rebuilding everything ... The patch consist only
	  to change the line on one line SET(CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX "d") with
	  SET(CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX "d" CACHE STRING "add a postfix, usually
	  d on windows")"

2008-05-27 17:32 +0000 [r8370]  robert:

	* From Lars Nilson, bug fix to Sector::computeMatrix()

2008-05-27 16:32 +0000 [r8369]  robert:

	* Added handling of \ within srings by using \\

2008-05-27 15:42 +0000 [r8368]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-27 15:30 +0000 [r8366-8367]  robert:

	* Reorginized the TerrainTile/TerrainTechnique dirty mechanism so
	  that TerrainTile now holds the dirty flag and enables/disables
	  event traversal in response dirty being set/unset. This allows
	  terrain to be automatically updated in response to Terrain scale
	  and sample ratio changes.

	* Introduced a TerrainHandler that adjust the sameple ratio and
	  vertical scale of terrain interactively using the 'r','R' and
	  'v','V' keys respecitvely.

2008-05-27 13:11 +0000 [r8365]  robert:

	* From John Vidar Larring, "Added vertical scale as a property of
	  osgTerrain::Terrain. Lets you configure vertical scale when
	  initializing the terrain model. E.g: osgTerrain::Terrain* terrain
	  = findTopMostNodeOfType<osgTerrain::Terrain>(model.get()); if
	  (!terrain) { terrain = new osgTerrain::Terrain;
	  terrain->addChild(model.get()); terrain->setVerticalScale(2.0f);
	  model = terrain; } viewerWindow->setSceneData(model.get()); "

2008-05-27 12:07 +0000 [r8363-8364]  robert:

	* Updated version numbers in prep for 2.5.1 release

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've refactored the single
	  ReadedWriterVRML2.cpp into multiple files. The reason for doing
	  this was to break up the horribly long function
	  osg::ref_ptr<osg::Node>
	  ReaderWriterVRML2::convertFromVRML(openvrml::node *obj) The fixes
	  are: * Added the source's parent directory as search directory
	  for image files. * The material properties are now set in the
	  stateset of the Geode rather than the Geometry. This will allow
	  geometries to be reused with different material properties in
	  future updates. NB: I planned for a caching scheme in which
	  multiple occurences of the same primitive (e.g., Cylinders with
	  radius 0.8 and height 1.2), would use the same Geometry object.
	  Unfortunately, my planning moved me to other areas, but I might
	  still finish the caching scheme in a quiet hour. For the time
	  being I decided it would be a good thing to already submit my
	  current changes. "

2008-05-27 11:13 +0000 [r8362]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Included a fix for my past pbuffer
	  change. The version test fo 'need at least glx 1.1' was broken,
	  even if no implementation had yet a chance to trigger that :)
	  Attached a fix for that broken test. Based on rev 8358"

2008-05-27 11:07 +0000 [r8361]  robert:

	* From Andrew Bettison, "Problem: the LineStipple pattern when read
	  from an OSG node file is always 0xFFFF, even though specified
	  otherwise in the OSG file. Cause: possibly a copy/paste typo in
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/LineStipple.cc, line 61: if
	  (fr[0].matchWord("functionMask") && fr[1].getUInt(mask))
	  Solution: change to: if (fr[0].matchWord("pattern") &&
	  fr[1].getUInt(mask))"

2008-05-27 11:04 +0000 [r8360]  robert:

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "Here is a patch that fix the strange
	  bug describe on the osg-user group. Finally it seems to not come
	  from the empty geode. The origin of the problem seems to be the
	  uniform initialization during the building of the program which
	  call a glUseProgram. If your scene never display the node that
	  contains the shader and if there is no other shader on the scene,
	  this "glUseProgram" is the only one that is called during your
	  simulation. So, this shader is applied on all the scene. I fix
	  this bug by switching off the shader (by calling glUseProgram(0)
	  ) during the compilation of a state which does not contain the
	  shader. "

2008-05-27 10:50 +0000 [r8359]  robert:

	* From Wang Rui, "I have just done some changes on the classic
	  osgdb_gif plugin (based on OSG 2.5.0). I wish our developers may
	  use the newly written GIF reading plugin to attach animate GIF
	  files as textures now! In my opinion, a GIF is much smaller than
	  AVI and MOVs, and much more efficient sometimes. Changes
	  includes: 1. A new GifImageStream class (inherit from
	  osg::ImageStream and OpenThreads::Thread) have already been added
	  to implement different operations of a GIF movie, such like
	  playing, pausing, rewinding, setting time and so on. 2. Some
	  small changes to decode_row() and gif_read_stream(), which make
	  the transparency of GIF images correctly. 3. Just a few changes
	  to the ReaderWriterGIF::readGIFStream() function, which ensure
	  that animate GIFs are loaded by GifImageStream (and the function
	  returns GifImageStream objects) and static GIFs unchanged (still
	  use the old method and returns osg::Image objects!). Attachments
	  are the cpp file and an animate GIF file for further test. Just
	  rebuild the osgdb_gif project and use osgviewer or osgmovie to
	  view it. The plugin has been tested on Windows and Arch Linux."

2008-05-26 22:36 +0000 [r8357-8358]  robert:

	* From Philip Lowman, post 1: "Here is a collection of changes

	  CMakeModules/Find3rdPartyDependencies.cmake: * Adds the
	  NO_DEFAULT_PATH option to all of the search options so that
	  things in C:\Program Files\OpenSceneGraph aren't accidently
	  picked up during configure time and instead only things in the
	  "3rdParty" folder are discovered. (general bugfix) " post 2: "Ok,
	  hold the presses. I just discovered that for some odd reason the
	  osgdb_* plugins under Linux aren't getting put under the
	  osgPlugins-2.5.0 folder. Not exactly sure why this broke, the
	  folder was there, just empty. I'll have to look into it this
	  evening." post 3: "Fixed, was caused by the switch to
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and some code in
	  osgPlugins/CMakeLists.txt that effectively overrides
	  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH on non-MSVC compilers to dump the plugins in
	  the plugins folder. I tweaked it to override
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY as well. Seems to work fine."

	* From Paul Martz, "When exporting a DrawArrays PrimitiveSet, the
	  DAE plugin computes an incorrect nbVerticesPerPoly if the first
	  index is not zero. The issue can be reproduced easily with:
	  osgconv cessna.osg cessna.dae Examination of the resulting .dae
	  file reveals several out-of-range tristrip indices; viewing the
	  .dae file in osgviewer causes a crash when OSG tries to lookup
	  those indices. Attached resolves this issue."

2008-05-26 21:53 +0000 [r8356]  robert:

	* From Art Tevs, "I've attached a patch for the Texture2DArray
	  which solves problems of loading image data into the texture
	  array. So here are a small description: - Solves issues of
	  loading image data into the texture memory - Print a warning if
	  images are of different dimensions or have different internal
	  formats (GL specification requires images to be the same) Patch
	  is tested and seems to work fine. It shouldn't break any other
	  functionality. It should go into include/osg and src/osg "

2008-05-26 21:44 +0000 [r8355]  robert:

	* Fixed copyright notice typo

2008-05-26 21:33 +0000 [r8353-8354]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "The attached code changes StateSet::merge() so
	  that it copies RenderBin data such as the rendering hint and
	  RenderBin details from rhs into "this", only if "this" has
	  RenderBin mode set to INHERIT. It replaces a comment by you
	  indicating something along these lines should be done. To me,
	  this seems like the right thing to do."

	* From Gino, "According to the 1.4.1 COLLADA spec (2nd ed) the
	  standard behavior for fx_sampler_wrap_common is as follows CLAMP
	  ->GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE NONE->GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER The current 2.5.0
	  daePlugin assumes the following binding CLAMP ->GL_CLAMP
	  NONE->GL_REPEAT Notably the GL_CLAMP binding will result in
	  visible black seams on input files that use otherwise matching
	  textures. Replacing GL_CLAMP by GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE solves this
	  problem. I've updated both the read and write functions. "

2008-05-26 21:18 +0000 [r8352]  robert:

	* From Philip Lowman, "I changed the test name to be a little
	  easier to understand and defaulted Linux & Windows builds to
	  false and to skip the compile check as you desired. "

2008-05-26 21:10 +0000 [r8350-8351]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is an update to the osgviewerWX example.
	  Keyboard events were not always received because the
	  GraphicsWindowWX wasn't receiving focus. It now receives focus
	  when the mouse enters the window. * I split the mouse handling
	  from a monolithic method to separate ones, slightly cleaner than
	  a whole bunch of if()'s, especially with another case of the
	  mouse entering the canvas. * I changed the EVT_KEY_DOWN handler
	  to an EVT_CHAR handler, although that now makes the up and down
	  handler assymetric. The new down-handler returns translated key
	  codes, so when you press the S key (without anything else), it
	  actually returns 's' and not 'S' as the EVT_KEY_DOWN did. This
	  means that statistics can be called up in the viewer window,
	  while the example previously only printed a "Stats output:" line
	  to the console. I'm not truly happy that the up handler returns
	  _untranslated_ key codes. But solving this completely would
	  probably mean adding some table that translated from wxWidgets'
	  untranslated key codes to OSG's internal ones. This might be
	  interesting to add, as anyone using OSG + wxWidgets in any
	  serious manner would also have to add this. * I commented out the
	  evt.Skip()'s in the keyboard handlers as these would only be
	  necessary if there were some key events that are not handled. But
	  currently all key events are simply forwarded. * I changed the
	  handling of a mouse drag to a more general mouse move"

2008-05-26 21:04 +0000 [r8349]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, "I had to tighten a declaration in
	  OpenFlight/FltWriteResult.h, as the Solaris SunStudio 11 compiler
	  was being picky and wouldn't compile."

2008-05-26 20:46 +0000 [r8348]  robert:

	* Added debug block to output the location of the master camera for
	  each View in a Viewer.

2008-05-26 17:30 +0000 [r8347]  robert:

	* Added continuous recording of the animation path to the
	  RecordAnimationPathHandler

2008-05-26 16:25 +0000 [r8346]  robert:

	* Introduce --pbuffer-only width height option, and added fps
	  reporting to stats output

2008-05-26 15:41 +0000 [r8345]  robert:

	* Added basic --pbuffer width height support

2008-05-26 14:30 +0000 [r8344]  robert:

	* Added better stats reporting

2008-05-26 12:01 +0000 [r8342-8343]  robert:

	* Added feedback of pixel format chosen for read back

	* Added automatic selection of the pixel type according to the
	  window type

2008-05-26 11:53 +0000 [r8341]  robert:

	* Added option for doing triple buffering, and set the default read
	  format to GL_RGBA

2008-05-25 22:06 +0000 [r8340]  robert:

	* Switch to using an inital draw callback when use --start-frame

2008-05-25 21:52 +0000 [r8339]  robert:

	* Added option for setting whether the front or back buffer should
	  be read using --front and --back command line options.

2008-05-25 21:35 +0000 [r8338]  robert:

	* Added option for controlling whether the front buffer is read at
	  the start of the frame or the back buffer at the end of the
	  frame.

2008-05-25 11:21 +0000 [r8337]  robert:

	* Added check for pkg-config so that build only use related package
	  checks when it's supported

2008-05-24 11:05 +0000 [r8336]  robert:

	* Added #define's for PixelBufferObject extensions. Added docs for
	  Camera::DrawCallback

2008-05-24 09:24 +0000 [r8335]  robert:

	* Added RenderStage::setClear*() methods from Camera::getClear*()
	  sources

2008-05-24 08:13 +0000 [r8334]  robert:

	* Changed default format to GL_BGR

2008-05-23 16:26 +0000 [r8333]  robert:

	* Added single buffered and double buffered PBO support, and
	  --no-pbo, --single-pbo and --double-pbo command line parameters

2008-05-22 17:50 +0000 [r8332]  robert:

	* Added basic glReadPixels code

2008-05-22 15:43 +0000 [r8331]  robert:

	* Added camera final callback attachment code.

2008-05-22 13:11 +0000 [r8329-8330]  robert:

	* Fixed name of source file

	* Added new osgscreencapture example folder, implementation to
	  follow

2008-05-22 12:38 +0000 [r8328]  robert:

	* Reorginaized the DatabaseQueue's to avoid warnings under Windows

2008-05-22 11:21 +0000 [r8327]  robert:

	* Fixed warning by adding in missing return

2008-05-22 08:31 +0000 [r8326]  robert:

	* Checking in missed header

2008-05-21 21:09 +0000 [r8325]  robert:

	* Refactored DatabasePager and related classes to introduce support
	  for multi-threaded paging, where the Pager manages threads of
	  reading local and http files via seperate threads. This makes it
	  possible to smoothly browse large databases where parts of the
	  data are locally cached while others are on a remote server.
	  Previously with this type of dataset the pager would stall all
	  paging while http requests were being served, even when parts of
	  the models are still loadable virtue of being in the local cache.
	  Also as part of the refactoring the DatabaseRequest are now
	  stored in the ProxyNode/PagedLOD nodes to facilitate quite
	  updating in the cull traversal, with the new code avoiding mutex
	  locks and searches. Previous on big databases the overhead
	  involved in make database requests could accumulate to a point
	  where it'd cause the cull traversal to break frame. The overhead
	  now is negligable. Finally OSG_FILE_CACHE support has been moved
	  from the curl plugin into the DatabasePager. Eventually this
	  functionality will be moved out into osgDB for more general
	  usage.

2008-05-20 09:28 +0000 [r8324]  robert:

	* Moved the compile to after the updateSceneView

2008-05-14 20:22 +0000 [r8323]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-14 17:03 +0000 [r8322]  robert:

	* Introduced preliminary support for asynchronous file read
	  requests, ReaderWriter::ReadResult now has a FILE_REQUEST enum.
	  ReaderWriter::Options now has a s/getAsynchronousFileReadHint()
	  parameter methods. libcurl based plugin now detects enabing of
	  the AsynchronousFileReadHint, but as yet does not handle async
	  requests - handling everything syncronously. DatabasePager now by
	  default will enable AsynchronousFileReadHint for http based file
	  requests

2008-05-14 14:59 +0000 [r8321]  robert:

	* Moved the cache file writing into StreamObject so that the cache
	  file is only created once data is being read.

2008-05-14 13:16 +0000 [r8320]  robert:

	* Introduced a thread safe map which manages a single EasyCurl
	  object per thread.

2008-05-14 12:47 +0000 [r8319]  robert:

	* Refactor curl usage so that a new EasyCurl class wraps up the
	  curl handle and reading from curl.

2008-05-13 18:28 +0000 [r8318]  robert:

	* Fixed lat/long ordering

2008-05-13 17:27 +0000 [r8317]  robert:

	* Added support for -e level minX minY maxX maxY extents controls

2008-05-13 14:08 +0000 [r8316]  robert:

	* Added --file-cache directoryname command line option support to
	  readNodeFiles(ArgumentParser&) to make it easier to specify a
	  local file cache, in place of the default OSG_FILE_CACHE env var.

2008-05-13 12:36 +0000 [r8315]  robert:

	* Further work on computing of lat/long range of PagedLOD subgraphs

2008-05-13 10:56 +0000 [r8314]  robert:

	* From Steven Thomas, "Subject: Collada fix There was a problem
	  converting a file to Collada by using osgconv like this: osgconv
	  file.osg file.dae You would get an error message: I/O error :
	  Permission denied I/O error : Permission denied error :
	  xmlNewTextWriterFilename : out of memory! Error:
	  daeLIBXMLPlugin::write(file://cessna.dae) failed Warning: Error
	  in writing to "cessna.dae". This was due to some bad URI
	  processing code in the Collada plugin. The attached file fixes
	  this by using the Collada DOM's URI processing functions. After
	  this change the file will convert successfully in the local
	  directory. "

2008-05-12 16:59 +0000 [r8313]  robert:

	* Added signal handling code, and prelimary lat/long computation

2008-05-12 15:42 +0000 [r8312]  robert:

	* Added missing getBound() method

2008-05-12 12:16 +0000 [r8309-8310]  robert:

	* Update ChangeLog and wrappers for 2.5.0 dev release

	* Updated AUTHORS for 2.5.0 release

2008-05-12 11:39 +0000 [r8308]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, Fixed FrameBufferObject attachement code
	  to handle cases where no texture or image is attached

2008-05-12 11:01 +0000 [r8307]  robert:

	* Updated version number for 2.5.0 dev release

2008-05-12 10:55 +0000 [r8306]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowski and Robert Osfield, moved command line
	  option usage setup from osgviewer example into
	  osg::ArgumentParser and osgViewer::Viewer to make them more
	  universally available.

2008-05-12 10:18 +0000 [r8304-8305]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, "* add easy multiple texture targets support for
	  obj by refactoring texture load into it's own method. * use new
	  method from step 1 to load 'map_opacity' textures from .mtl
	  files"

	* From Mathias Froehlich, fixed typo

2008-05-11 14:26 +0000 [r8303]  robert:

	* Added CARIO_FOUND into svg plugins checks

2008-05-11 14:23 +0000 [r8302]  robert:

	* From Miguel Escriva, Here you will find a SVG Image Reader. It
	  renders a SVG file as an osg::Image using cairo and rsvg.

2008-05-10 17:25 +0000 [r8300-8301]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "This change adds support for osg::Billboards to
	  the OpenFlight exporter. It might seem odd that the change
	  actually removes the stub apply(Billboard&) method, but it turns
	  out Billboards are easily supported in subordinate routines of
	  the existing apply(Geode&) method with s dynamic_cast, so there's
	  no need for a separate apply(Billboard&)."

	* From Paul Martz, "Another round of plugin enhancements. 3DC:
	  Output now uses osg::notify. JPEG: Now returns correct error code
	  for empty input file. FreeType: Prevent possible crash if Options
	  is NULL."

2008-05-10 17:04 +0000 [r8299]  robert:

	* Moved compile setup from osgViewer::ViewerBase into
	  osgViewer::Renderer to avoid threading issues associated with
	  compile running in a parallel with update/cull on the first
	  frame. Also added automatic recompile when a new SceneData is
	  applied to a View.

2008-05-09 17:22 +0000 [r8298]  robert:

	* Added --file-cache command line option to compliment -c

2008-05-09 17:08 +0000 [r8297]  robert:

	* Initial cut of file cache population app

2008-05-09 11:54 +0000 [r8296]  robert:

	* From Art Trevs, set the _geometryVerticesOut to default to 1 as a
	  workaround for OpenGL driver bug that incorrectly reports a
	  warning when value is 0.

2008-05-09 11:27 +0000 [r8295]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Attached are some minor plugin fixes. PNM, RGB,
	  and JPEG would all crash if attempting to read an empty file, and
	  FLT would go into an infinite loop. All are fixed with this
	  change. I also fixed some return values for a couple of these,
	  changing FILE_NOT_HANDLED to ERROR_IN_READING_FILE where
	  appropriate."

2008-05-09 10:27 +0000 [r8294]  robert:

	* From Jeremy Moles, fixed window resize problem

2008-05-08 17:02 +0000 [r8293]  robert:

	* Added missing check against handling invalid bounding sphere's

2008-05-08 16:48 +0000 [r8291-8292]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "I found one compilation error in OSG 2.4
	  in the Inventor plugin, where one node (SoTextureCoordinate3) was
	  assumed to be available in all versions of Inventor but is
	  actually only available in Coin. The use of the node is now
	  protected by #ifdef __COIN__ constructs. The attachment is based
	  on OSG 2.4, not SVN."

	* From Melchior Franz, "In KDE I switch desktops with Super-Tab,
	  and occasionally I get an excess Tab key report when switching
	  back to an OSG application (usually FlightGear :-). Although KDE
	  has consumed the Tab, it's sometimes still in the XKeymapEvent's
	  key_vector, and followed by a Tab KeyRelease event. Avoid this
	  artifact by - asking for a "fresh" keymap (via XQueryKeymap()),
	  rather than using the unreliable(?) XKeymapEvent's key_vector,
	  and by - flushing all key events on focus-in (to avoid the
	  KeyRelease) After Super-press, Tab-press, Super-release,
	  Tab-release (note the wrong release order!) I still get an extra
	  Tab event. But this is not surprising and not exactly wrong
	  either. Also it's hard to avoid, as we can't see what happened to
	  the keyboard before we regained focus. Files changed:
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp
	  include/osgViewer/api/X11/GraphicsWindowX11"

2008-05-08 16:39 +0000 [r8290]  robert:

	* From Jeremy Moles, osgviewerGTK example

2008-05-08 15:17 +0000 [r8289]  robert:

	* From Sebastien Messerschmidt, "attached you'll find a patch for
	  the shp-plugin. I've spotted huge memory leaks int ShapeParser
	  and fixed them. Also, there was a missing destructor (PolygonM)
	  and a missing member initialization (PolygonZ) Would be nice if
	  someone could test the changes. To release the memory just if no
	  reading error happened (and therefore the arrays would be valid)
	  I've added an macro to release and reset the pointers at once.
	  I'm not using macros myself very often as I don't like them, but
	  I think it doesn't hurt in this code. "

2008-05-08 15:14 +0000 [r8288]  robert:

	* Updated ChangeLog and osgversion to catch Raymond de Vries name
	  correctly

2008-05-08 14:00 +0000 [r8287]  robert:

	* From Raymond de Vries, "This fix tests the right variable before
	  it is allocated. Fortunately, until now it tested another
	  variable (_particleSizeUniform, which is, at that moment, not
	  allocated as well) and everything went ok. So it does not fix a
	  crash or so, it is a matter of correct code. Line 353 is changed
	  from if (!_particleSizeUniform) to if (!_particleColorUniform) "

2008-05-08 13:56 +0000 [r8286]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "As I discovered prior to the 2.4 release, the
	  FLT export geometry backend was using some old turn-on code,
	  originally written just to enable other development but not
	  intended for actual release. Sadly, my OSG training commitments
	  prevented me from fixing this prior to 2.4. In essence, the FLT
	  exporter was emitting a full set of Mesh records each time it
	  encountered a PrimitiveSet. Attached is a fix. The code now emits
	  the Mesh set up records, then iterates over all PrimitiveSets and
	  emits a Mesh Primitive record per PrimitiveSet. It also loops
	  over PrimitiveSets twice, first writing Face records according to
	  the mode, the writing Mesh records (again according to the mode).
	  The final change included here is support for GL_POINTS as
	  single-vertex Face records. Billboards are still to come."

2008-05-08 13:46 +0000 [r8285]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-08 13:22 +0000 [r8284]  robert:

	* From Roland Smeenk, "Small typo and implementation fix for
	  setInitialDrawCallback."

2008-05-08 12:55 +0000 [r8283]  robert:

	* From Philip Lowman, "Attached is a patch to the toplevel
	  CMakeLists.txt which adds an automated test for
	  OSG_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT. This should help ease initial
	  configuration on OS X systems."

2008-05-08 12:36 +0000 [r8282]  robert:

	* From Garrett Potts and Robert Osfield, changes to build against

	  7.1"

2008-05-07 14:17 +0000 [r8276]  robert:

	* From Miguel Escriva, "Attached to this mail you will find some
	  files to work with the Philips WOWvx displays. It's implemented
	  in the same way that 3D Spherical Display and Panoramic Spherical
	  Display. You can test it running: osgviewer --wowvx-20 cow.osg
	  osgviewer --wowvx-42 cow.osg depending on the size of your
	  Philips WOWvx display (20" or 42") Other arguments you can use to
	  control the 3D effect are: --wow-content <value> This value
	  defines the kind of content that can be: 0: No depth 1: Signage
	  2: Movie 3: CGI 4: Still --wow-factor <value> Percentage of the

	* From Terry Welsh, fixed typo of getEnd()

2008-05-07 13:46 +0000 [r8274]  robert:

	* From Jeremy Moles,"Here's a small example I us to test text
	  rendering in osgWidget; I figured it might be helpful to folks in
	  OSG who need to do the same. "

2008-05-07 13:42 +0000 [r8273]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've added hardware mipmap support to
	  Texture3D."

	  search for curllib if it can't find libcurl. Mike's 3rdParty only
	  has curllib. I realize now that the in appended file I have
	  earlier removed searching for freetype219 since I have it but it

2008-04-18 11:09 +0000 [r8135]  robert:

	* Introduce OSG_GL_ERROR_CHECKING env var checking to osg::State

2008-04-17 15:30 +0000 [r8132]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a refactored and
	  improved quicktime-plugin. I moved all code related to the
	  image-loading, swizzling etc into an extra class. The quicktime
	  plugin supports now reading and writing images from/to streams
	  and the code is less cluttered than previous versions. I removed
	  QTtexture.h/.cpp and added QTImportExport.h/.cpp. I updated the
	  CMake-files, I hope they are alright. I used the submitted code
	  in my own apps since two months or so and it seems pretty stable,
	  but as always the migration to the osg-quicktime plugin may have
	  introduced new bugs, so perfect for developer release :)"

2008-04-17 11:12 +0000 [r8127]  robert:

	* From John Shue, build fix for QT 3.x

2008-04-17 09:04 +0000 [r8122]  shuber:

	  compiling OpenGL objects per frame.

2008-04-16 15:23 +0000 [r8118-8119]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, "he attached are conversions of the 3 main
	  places i found in osg where tokens are used to represent bitmasks
	  with 'magic' numbers, like 32. i've changed these to a more
	  representative bitshift representation, showing clearly in which
	  bit you can expect this token to manifest. ie, converted things
	  like: from: DEEP_COPY_STATESETS = 8, to: DEEP_COPY_STATESETS =
	  1<<3, showing clearly that this isn't the _value_ 8, but the
	  _bit_ 8. this is an old pattern i see (and like to promulgate) to
	  make code a bit more readable and maintainable. "

	* Updated version number for nex dev release

2008-04-16 10:01 +0000 [r8107]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, cursor inheritance support

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-04-15 19:46 +0000 [r8103]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, "The following changes fix the flickering
	  issue I'm seeing when trying to externally manage my cursor in
	  Win32. If you set the cursor to InheritCursor,
	  GraphicsWindowWin32 ignores WM_SETCURSOR and assumes you will set
	  the cursor yourself."

2008-04-15 19:36 +0000 [r8102]  robert:

	* From Art Trevs, moved multile render targets support from
	  RenderStage into FrameBufferObject. From Robert Osfield,
	  refactored the FrameBufferObejcts::_drawBuffers set up so that
	  its done within the setAttachment method to avoid potential
	  threading/execution order issues.

2008-04-15 12:52 +0000 [r8099]  robert:

	* Added subdivision of Goedes

2008-04-13 14:32 +0000 [r8092-8093]  robert:

	* From Christian Kaser, "I discovered a bug that lead to a space
	  being displayed at the start of the new line after an automatic
	  line break (through setMaximumWidth()). The fix simply skips all
	  spaces at the end of the line, before skipping a line break which
	  was done already. osgText/Text.cpp: Line 502 ... else { ++itr; }
	  if (itr!=_text.end()) { // skip over spaces and return. while
	  (*itr==' ') ++itr; // New if (*itr=='\n') ++itr; } // move to new
	  line. switch(_layout) { .."

	* From Paul Martz, added osgocclussionquery and osgthirdpersonview
	  examples

2008-04-12 10:02 +0000 [r8091]  robert:

	* Changed bias parameter to scale

2008-04-11 13:43 +0000 [r8086]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz,"Several misc changes, but the major fixes
	  include: * Support for Vec4ubArray for color data * Support for
	  material transparency Thanks to Neil Hughes, Jason Daly,
	  yourself, and others for testing and reporting issues."

2008-04-11 13:28 +0000 [r8085]  robert:

	* From Philipp Machler, "We have extended the support for Wacom
	  Tablet devices: - Mac OS X - not only pressure, but tilt and
	  z-rotation is supported now "

2008-04-11 13:04 +0000 [r8083-8084]  robert:

	* Added reference to osgstereomatch example to
	  osgmultiplerendertargets. Added usage example use
	  OpenSceneGraph-Data/Images examples

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "Here is a patch for cmakelists.txt to add
	  support for the /MP option in Microsoft compilers as discussed in
	  osg-users. There is now an advanced option called WIN32_USE_MP
	  (which defaults to OFF) that will enable the /MP switch for all
	  builds. I tucked this code block safely within a IF(WIN32)
	  branch."

2008-04-11 11:58 +0000 [r8082]  robert:

	* From Jose Delport, a MRT example implementing stereo matching.

2008-04-11 11:19 +0000 [r8080]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-04-11 11:10 +0000 [r8079]  robert:

	* From Melchior Franz, "The GUIEventAdapter header file had
	  KeySymbols for the super and hyper keys defined already, but
	  these modifiers were missing in GUIEventAdapter::ModKeyMask, and
	  the EventQueue ingored them as well. The attached diff/archive
	  adds the missing parts for Super/Hyper modifier key support. I'm
	  aware that this might not be supported on all systems/keyboards
	  out of the box, but decided to submit it anyway because: -
	  developers are aware of differences between input devices (Some
	  mice have scroll wheels, others don't. Some have five or more
	  buttons, some have only one. Some keyboards don't have numpads,
	  some have AltGr, some don't etc.) - even if someone relies on
	  Hyper/Super in distributed software, this is easy to fix and
	  doesn't create lock-in conditions - while the names Hyper/Super
	  may only be common on X11, they are just symbol names and not
	  OS-specific - even though some systems might not offer these
	  additional modifiers by default, it's likely that all of them
	  have at least 8 modifier levels internally, so it should only be
	  a matter of OS configuration to make them work - having
	  super/hyper available is useful to offer a user ways to define
	  local key definitions that are safe from collisions with
	  predefined "official" key assignments"

2008-04-11 10:58 +0000 [r8078]  robert:

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "Modified the cmakelists.txt file for the
	  curl plugin so the proper linker directories are set in Win32.
	  The old cmakelists.txt would set the lib release folder for debug
	  builds as well. This should correct that."

2008-04-11 10:31 +0000 [r8076-8077]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, fixed typo.

	* From Benoit Laniel, "I use mingw to cross-compile openscenegraph
	  to win32. However, linux filesystem is case-sensitive. Here are
	  the modifications needed to make the compiler happy. These are
	  only some include lines rewritten (Io.h to io.h, Windows.h to
	  windows.h etc.) for version 2.3.7."

2008-04-11 10:16 +0000 [r8074]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, "1) add simplifier command "--simplifier .5" to
	  reduce complexity 2) complementarily add a "--overallNormal" to
	  replace per-vert/per-facet normals with an overall. simplifier
	  doesn't work in certain cases without less complex normals. this
	  gets that done. 3) add env var output with full verbose output so
	  people realize it's active when the app is run - i see this all
	  the time in training where people run osgconv, with unintended
	  data transformations due to osgUtil:;Optimzer, for example"

2008-04-11 10:10 +0000 [r8073]  robert:

	* Added --mouse option to enable mouse tracking, and fixed bug in
	  assumption that nv is not null.

2008-04-03 18:36 +0000 [r8038]  robert:

	* Introduced CMake build option for compiling double or float
	  versions of osg::BoundingSphere and osg::BoundingBox. Introduced
	  code in BoundgingSphere, BoundingBox, ProxyNode and LOD to
	  utilise the above settings. Added Matrix::value_type,
	  Plane::value_type, BoundingSphere::value_type and
	  BoundingBox::value_type command line options that report where
	  the types of floats or doubles.

2008-04-03 18:06 +0000 [r8037]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, "The X11WindowingSystemInterface in
	  osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp unconditionally sets the X11
	  error handler routine, replacing anything that was previously
	  set. This is a bit unfriendly, as the X11 error handler is a
	  global attribute which the application, or the GUI toolkit being
	  used, may well have set itself. So I have modified
	  X11WindowingSystemInterface to only replace the error handler if
	  it is the default i.e. if the application has not set it."

2008-04-03 10:26 +0000 [r8033]  robert:

	* From Mattias Helsing, "While using the dds plugin (via osgdem) it
	  was able to write 24bit images with BGR order but not read them.
	  My 2-liner fixed it for me but it may be that someone with more
	  knowledge of the plugin want to insert more pixel formats in the
	  reading part of the plugin."

2008-04-02 17:08 +0000 [r8032]  robert:

	* From Jose Delport, added support for MRT via glDrawBuffers

2008-04-02 13:57 +0000 [r8030-8031]  robert:

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Subject: osga reading slash mismatch
	  requests for files in a archive are made with unix style paths.
	  So to be able to match an entry in map(_indexMap) it's keys needs
	  to be stored in unix style even on Win32" Note from Robert
	  Osfied, simplified this submission so that the added conversion
	  to unix slahes is done on all platforms as this should be safe
	  and simpler to maintain.

	* Updated to reflect new COLOR_BUFFER0 value

2008-04-02 13:48 +0000 [r8028-8029]  robert:

	* From Jose Delport, introduced osgmultiplerendertargets example

	* Changed the Camera::BufferComponent::COLOR_BUFFER0 from being
	  equal to COLOR_BUFFER to being COLOR_BUFFER+1 to enable
	  differentation between non MRT and MRT paths.

2008-04-02 11:28 +0000 [r8027]  robert:

	* From Jose Delport, typo fixes

2008-04-01 17:22 +0000 [r8025]  robert:

	* Updated ChangeLog, osgversion and AUTHOR.txt for 2.3.7 dev

	* Updated OpenThreads version to 2.2.1 with the switch of
	  sources/svn:externals from OpenThreads to OpenSceneGraph.

2008-04-01 10:49 +0000 [r8020]  robert:

	* Moved OpenThreads directly into OpenSceneGraph/trunk rather than
	  being introduced via svn:externals. This change has been done to
	  make it easier for OpenSceneGraph users to check out the svn via
	  https without any conflicts introduced with a http externals.

2008-04-01 10:33 +0000 [r8019]  robert:

	* Updated version numbers for 2.3.7 dev release

2008-04-01 10:11 +0000 [r8018]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Two changes: - Handle DrawArrays first/count
	  correctly (fixes problem reported by Jason Daly) - Display
	  warning if non-Geometry Drawable is encountered."

2008-04-01 10:00 +0000 [r8017]  robert:

	* From Tatsuhiro Nishioka and Stephan Huber, bug fixes and
	  enhancement of cursor suppoort.

2008-03-31 16:23 +0000 [r8016]  robert:

	* Added checks for a valid scene graph before doing various ops on
	  it.

2008-03-31 14:00 +0000 [r8015]  robert:

	* From Andy Skinner, build fix for Solaris

2008-03-31 11:44 +0000 [r8014]  robert:

	* Added Camera::s/getClearAccum, s/getClearStencil and
	  s/getClearDepth.

2008-03-31 09:43 +0000 [r8013]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-29 09:59 +0000 [r8011]  robert:

	* From Sherman Wilcox with a little reorganisation from Robert
	  Osfield, added test for 0 sized subloads, ignoring them to
	  prevent a divide by zero error occuring on some buggy drivers.

2008-03-28 19:56 +0000 [r8010]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Some small changes and code cleanup. Biggest
	  change is an improvement to the WriteResult return."

2008-03-28 18:42 +0000 [r8009]  robert:

	* Set Texture::setMaxAnisotropy() to 16.0f for better quality
	  terrain when looking at shallow angle.

2008-03-28 17:53 +0000 [r8008]  robert:

	* Improved the error capture and reporting

2008-03-28 15:52 +0000 [r8007]  robert:

	* Rewrote the DatabasePager::removeExpiredSubgraphs(double) routine
	  as it as not expiring subgraphs quick enough to enable reasonable
	  load balancing. New version isn't perfect and will need further
	  work, but does at least reduce the memory footprint by as much as
	  half on test paths on big databases. The rewritten method no
	  longer uses the the MaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs and
	  MinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs variables so these and associated
	  methods for accessing them have been removed. - /** Set the
	  maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per frame */ - void
	  setMaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs(unsigned int number) {
	  _maximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs = number; } - - /** Get the
	  maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per frame */ -
	  unsigned int getMaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs() const {
	  return _maximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs; } - - /** Set the
	  minimum number of inactive PagedLOD child to keep */ - void
	  setMinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs(unsigned int number) {
	  _minimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs = number; } - - /** Get the
	  minimum number of inactive PagedLOD child to keep */ - unsigned
	  int getMinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs() const { return
	  _minimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs; }

2008-03-28 15:31 +0000 [r8006]  robert:

	* Introduced mutex into Terrain node to manage the tile system data
	  structures

2008-03-28 15:28 +0000 [r8005]  robert:

	* Reordered set up of scene and event handlers to prevent warning

2008-03-28 13:22 +0000 [r8004]  robert:

	* Removed old lower case versions

2008-03-28 12:44 +0000 [r8003]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Here's the mods to the OpenFlight plugin to
	  support FLT export. The ZIP file contains the new .cpp/h files as
	  well as existing files that I modified. Changes to existing
	  files: ReaderWriter.cpp -- to support writeNode() of course.
	  ReaderWriterATTR.cpp -- to support writeObject -- we write .attr
	  files for textures, if they don't already exist. AttrData.cpp/.h
	  -- Minor fixes. CMakeLists.txt -- to include the new files in the
	  build." From Robert Osfield, port to non Windows platforms just
	  required fixing of header capitilization errors that windows lets
	  through the net due to having a case insensitive file system.

2008-03-27 13:21 +0000 [r8002]  robert:

	* Removed TileSystem class, and added support for TerrainTile's
	  automatically registering and unregistering themseles with the
	  enclosing Terrain node.

2008-03-27 11:56 +0000 [r8000-8001]  robert:

	* Added wrapper for TerrainTile

	* Renamed osgTerrain::TerrainSystem to osgTerrain::Terrain

2008-03-27 10:55 +0000 [r7999]  robert:

	* Renamed Terrain to TerrainTile

2008-03-26 20:06 +0000 [r7998]  robert:

	* Introduce TerrainSystem node which decorates a complete terrain
	  model made up of Terrain tiles.

2008-03-26 20:03 +0000 [r7996-7997]  robert:

	* From Carlo Camporesi, "I have made some changes in order to allow
	  the using of proxies via env variables and options. I have
	  modified also the cmakelist. In this way osg is able to find the
	  library in 3rdParty directory."

	* From Carlo Comporesi, adding support of finding libcurl in 3rd
	  party dependencies

2008-03-25 15:21 +0000 [r7995]  robert:

	* From Tomas Hnilica, " Attached is modified source of
	  AdapterWidget.cpp file from osgviewerQT example. Original was
	  token today from SVN - trunk. (2.3.6). --mdi option needs to be
	  set to run MDI version. Few notes: - tested on Windows box (Win
	  XP) - using QT4 - I was not able to execute the example with
	  QOSGWidget - had same error like described in [osg-users] "fate
	  error using QOSGWidget in develop release 2.3.0" thread from

	  AdapterWidget class constructor following line was added:
	  setFocusPolicy(Qt::ClickFocus); Scene disappearing by resizing to
	  minimum still needs to be fixed..."

2008-03-25 13:14 +0000 [r7994]  robert:

	* Fixed LessGeode operator.

2008-03-25 11:50 +0000 [r7990]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Leandowski, "I removed few lines of code that were
	  setting Threading mode and Screen mode. I believe they are now
	  not neccessary because the same does osgViewer::Viewer argument
	  parser. In fact argument list does not contain these args after
	  they were parsed by osgViewer::Viewer constructor. I also allowed
	  myself to add ThreadingHandler to the example."

2008-03-24 18:06 +0000 [r7989]  robert:

	* Added sampling down to 32x32 mesh for 64x64 height fields as a
	  workaround to memory consumption issues with high res whole earth
	  paged databases.

2008-03-24 18:03 +0000 [r7988]  robert:

	* Added mutex to prevent multiple cull threads changing the
	  MultiTextureControl at one time.

	* Added full range of cameras manipulators to
	  osgmultitexturecontrol example

2008-03-23 18:28 +0000 [r7986]  robert:

	* Added < and > key bindings to allow the speed to be animation
	  speed to be increased or decreased.

2008-03-21 18:35 +0000 [r7985]  robert:

	* Added preliminary file cache support. Enabled by setting the
	  OSG_FILE_CACHE variable.

2008-03-21 18:31 +0000 [r7984]  robert:

	* Added missing break; at end of each case entry.

2008-03-21 13:08 +0000 [r7981]  robert:

	* Added initial cut of libcurl based plugin

2008-03-20 10:24 +0000 [r7979]  robert:

	* Updated date for 2.4.6 release

2008-03-19 21:05 +0000 [r7978]  robert:

	* From Melchoir Franz, "osgViewer toggled the NumLock state
	  correctly when pressing the NumLock key, but it didn't pick up
	  the initial state. So, if NumLock was on for the OS at startup
	  (LED on), it was still off for OSG. And the first keypress turned
	  the LED off, and NumLock on for OSG. The attached fix picks up
	  the state on every FocusIn, just like it was done in the last
	  commits for CapsLock. The difference is, that the NumLock mask
	  isn't standardized (e.g. 0x10 for Linux, and 0x80 for AIX), so we
	  have to do a reverse lookup (::rescanModifierMapping()). Note
	  that I could not reproduce the problem on my system, but someone
	  else confirmed it twice on his, and the patch fixed it for him.
	  Changed files: ./include/osgViewer/api/X11/GraphicsWindowX11
	  ./src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp "

2008-03-19 17:11 +0000 [r7976-7977]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-19 12:09 +0000 [r7974]  robert:

	* From Sebastian Messerschimdt, Added polygon offset controls

2008-03-19 11:41 +0000 [r7971-7973]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Revert the Camera::setInheritanceMask(0x) calls that were added
	  as workaround to a bug introduced by a bug fix to the way the
	  inhertiance mask was handled in CullVisito::apply(Camera&)

	* Introduced InheritanceMaskActionOnAttributeSetting member to
	  CullSettings, and associated applyMaskAction method that is now
	  used in all CullSettings::set*() methods, which by default helps
	  disable the inheritance mask associated with settings that are
	  made locally.

2008-03-18 17:44 +0000 [r7970]  robert:

	* Set the CullSettings::InhertianceMask to 0x0 as temporary measure
	  till we work out the best scheme to use w.r.t inhertiance of
	  CullSettins.

2008-03-18 15:48 +0000 [r7969]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-18 15:37 +0000 [r7968]  robert:

	* To osg::AutoTransform added support for MinimumScale,
	  MaximumScale and AutoScaleTransitionWidth parameters and a new
	  scheme for computing the scaling when using autoscale that
	  introduces smooth transitions to the scaling of the subgraph so
	  that it looks more natural.

2008-03-18 10:45 +0000 [r7967]  robert:

	* Added example code showing how to set the minimum and maximum
	  scales

	* Added minimum and maximum scale support to osg::AutoTransform

2008-03-17 12:23 +0000 [r7964]  robert:

	* Fixed moving model bug where the moving model code was looking
	  for a transform with DataVariance set to DYNAMIC, but the scene
	  graph set up code was leaving the setting to default to STATIC.
	  Fix involved setting DataVariance on moving transoforms to
	  DYNAMIC.

2008-03-17 12:13 +0000 [r7961-7963]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Added doxygen docs

	* Introduce
	  osgParticle::ParticleSystem::s/getParticleScaleReferenceFrame()
	  to help manage the scaling of particles, whether they should be
	  relative to the local coordiante frame of the particle system, or
	  be in world coordinates.

2008-03-17 10:29 +0000 [r7960]  robert:

	* Added fire effect, enabled by --fire command line option. The new
	  fire effect has been introduced to reproduce the scaling of
	  paricle effects

2008-03-15 19:27 +0000 [r7959]  robert:

	* Added better error reporting

2008-03-14 16:51 +0000 [r7957]  robert:

2008-03-14 15:33 +0000 [r7953-7955]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Added utilty script for cleaning up build files/directories.

	* Fixed indenting

2008-03-14 15:13 +0000 [r7952]  robert:

	* From Melchior Franz, "Attached is a fix for remaining problems in
	  capslock handling: It sets osgGA's keymask when restoring keys on
	  FocusIn, according to the state values of XKeyEvent and
	  XCrossingEvent. (These are the only source for X11's current
	  capslock state that avoids pulling in the XKB extension.) "

2008-03-14 15:00 +0000 [r7951]  robert:

	* Missing checkin

2008-03-14 14:35 +0000 [r7950]  robert:

	* Added iostream include

2008-03-14 13:21 +0000 [r7949]  robert:

	* Added cloning of the StateSet before modification to work around
	  threading issue relating to the StateSet being modified by the
	  event/update thread and read from the draw thread at the same
	  time.

2008-03-14 12:03 +0000 [r7948]  robert:

	* Converted static const unsigned int definitio to enum.

	* Updated version/author type fixes, authors, readme and changelog
	  for 2.3.5 dev release

2008-03-14 11:07 +0000 [r7944-7946]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Improved the indenting

	* Fixed doc comment

2008-03-13 19:44 +0000 [r7941]  robert:

	* Removed gl and glu prefixes from SceneGraphBuilder methods to
	  avoid problems under Solaris

2008-03-13 16:40 +0000 [r7939-7940]  robert:

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've added a few fixes to the VRML 2.0
	  plugin: 1) Full DOS paths are now correctly opened by OpenVRML. A
	  URL containing a DOS path should be "file:///C:data/blah" rather
	  than "file://C:data/blah". 2) The last primitive defined in
	  "coordIndex" is now added if the "coordIndex" is not terminated
	  by -1. 3) Smoothed normals are computed if no normal field is
	  provided. Currently, there is no support for "creaseAngle", so
	  all edges (even the ones sharper than the creaseAngle) are
	  smoothed. I might add this in the future if demand rises. 4) If
	  an IndexedFaceSet contains only triangles or quads then the
	  primitive type is set to TRIANGLES or QUADS, and the primset
	  becomes DrawArrays rather than DrawArrayLengths. Question: I
	  noticed that for DrawArrays you can still provide an index array.
	  Would the rendering be faster if I'd create DrawElements primsets
	  rather than DrawArrays? Phrased differently, what is the benefit
	  of using DrawElements over DrawArrays, as there is clearly not a
	  one-to-one mapping of these concepts to their OpenGL
	  counterparts? 5) Objects are added to the transparent bin and
	  blend mode is enabled only if the transparency is nonzero.
	  Rendered transparent objects no longer write the depth buffer."

	* From Jose Delport, "attached is a version of osgunittests that
	  does not give false alarms for the case where q1 = -q2. The
	  output of 'osgunittests quat' is now much cleaner. "

2008-03-13 16:22 +0000 [r7938]  robert:

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is an updated osgviewerWX example to bring
	  it more in line with the other GUI toolkit examples. It now takes
	  a model file as command-line argument (complaining if there isn't
	  one), and its startup window size is now actually applied (it
	  used to be too small). I tested this with a unicode-build of
	  wxWidgets, as that is the recommended build type on Linux with
	  GTK. I'm pretty sure this version of the example will work for
	  the ANSI build as well, but I have no way of testing."

2008-03-13 16:18 +0000 [r7937]  robert:

	* From Melchoir Franz, "ac3d.cpp does currently strip everything
	  but the file name in "texture" paths. This is to drop absolute
	  paths that some 3d editors export (even AC3D itself!). But this
	  also strips directories of relative paths, which is wrong and
	  contradicts the ac3d reference implementation. (The reference
	  implementation doesn't strip anything, though, and so takes the
	  absolute paths as they are. Definitely not what we want.) The
	  attached solution checks absolute paths and only strips those:
	  (1) A:\\foo\\bar.png -> bar.png (as before) (2) /foo/bar.png ->
	  bar.png (as before) (3) foo/bar.png -> foo/bar.png (new) (4)
	  ../foo/bar.png -> ../foo/bar.png (new) "

2008-03-13 16:12 +0000 [r7936]  robert:

	* From Melchoir Franz, Caps lock support under X11

2008-03-13 16:05 +0000 [r7934-7935]  robert:

	* Added double versions of intersect methods

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-13 15:23 +0000 [r7932-7933]  robert:

	* From Andy Skinner, "I've taken this another step, to use
	  value_type inside the intersect calls. I did choose to use sqrt()
	  instead of sqrtf()."

	* From Paul Martz, files for adding ObjectRecordData support into
	  OpenFlight

2008-03-13 14:09 +0000 [r7931]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "The attached preserves OpenFlight Object record
	  data as UserData in the osg::Group corresponding to the Object
	  record. The files are: include/osgSim/ObjectRecordData -- The new
	  class. Derives from Object to support .osg IO.
	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PrimaryRecords.cpp -- Reads data into
	  that class. src/osgPlugins/osgSim/IO_ObjectRecordData.cpp -- .osg
	  IO support." From Robert Osfield, made the OpenFlight read object
	  record data optional via the -O readObjectRecordData ReaderWriter
	  option.

2008-03-13 13:44 +0000 [r7929-7930]  robert:

	* Added support for assigning state to created drawables,
	  implemented gluDisk.

	* From Alberto Luaces, "Here I send minor corrections to the text
	  output by the osgforest example when building its graphs. The
	  message "Creating billboard based forest" appears four times
	  regardless of the actual type of the graph being built. "

2008-03-12 20:20 +0000 [r7928]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-12 20:15 +0000 [r7926-7927]  robert:

	* Added default implementations of new SceneGraphBuilder class

2008-03-11 13:23 +0000 [r7923]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "it appears to me that sun CC cannot use
	  static functions from template functions. The attached change is
	  required to make it compile with sun CC."

2008-03-11 13:19 +0000 [r7922]  robert:

	* From Jose Delport, added support for finding and using GDAL 1.5

2008-03-11 12:10 +0000 [r7921]  robert:

	* Added extra event handlers to make viewer more functional

	* Added commandline help options

2008-03-05 13:54 +0000 [r7919]  robert:

	  Attribute file

2008-03-05 12:05 +0000 [r7918]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-05 11:52 +0000 [r7917]  robert:

	* From Atr Trevs, added missinging initializers

2008-03-05 11:33 +0000 [r7916]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I changed osgGA::StateSetManipulator
	  to mirror the osgViewer::StatsHandler and other handlers which
	  allow you to change the key(s) you would press to get them to do
	  something. Pretty simple change but useful in our context and
	  possibly in others too."

2008-03-04 17:57 +0000 [r7915]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, " The problem can be reproduced by
	  simply changing the osgpick example to use a CompositeViewer with
	  a single view initialized using setUpViewAcrossAllScreens(). I
	  have attached a modified osgpick.cpp so you can test it out
	  quickly (please don't check this file in though :-) ) The
	  eventState is then incorrect and picking does not work. The only
	  changes are in CompositeViewer.cpp (eventTraversal() method), and
	  fix the problem for me. "

2008-03-04 16:39 +0000 [r7914]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, "Attached is an updated to
	  osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32. The win32 pbuffer implementation
	  returned an error unless both the WGL_ARB_pbuffer and the
	  WGL_ARB_render_texture functions were present. This was too
	  restrictive, as a pbuffer can usefully be created without
	  render-to-texture, e.g. for use with glReadPixels. The osg
	  1.2/Producer pbuffers worked without RTT, and
	  osgUtil::RenderStage has all the code to handle both RTT and
	  non-RTT pbuffers, doing a read and copy in the latter case. With
	  these changes I have successfully tested the osgprerender example
	  on a graphics card which supports RTT, and one which doesn't.
	  Plus tested in my own application. In order to aid diagnostics I
	  have also added more function status return checks, and
	  associated error messages. I have included the win32 error text
	  in all error messages output. And there were some errors with
	  multi-threaded handling of "bind to texture" and a temporary
	  window context which I have corrected. These is one
	  (pre-existing) problem with multi-threaded use of pbuffers in
	  osgViewer & osgprerender, which I have not been able to fix. A
	  win32 device context (HDC) can only be destroyed from the thread
	  that created it. The pbuffers for pre-render cameras are created
	  in osgUtil::RenderStage::runCameraSetUp, from the draw thread.
	  But closeImplementation is normally invoked from the destructor
	  in the main application thread. With the additional error
	  messages I have added, osgprerender will now output a couple of
	  warnings from osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32::closeImplementation()
	  at exit, after running multi-threaded on windows. I think that is
	  a good thing, to highlight the problem. I looked into fixing it
	  in osgViewer::Renderer & osgUtil::RenderStage, but it was too
	  involved for me. My own application requirements are only
	  single-threaded. Unrelated fix - an uninitialised variable in
	  osg::GraphicsThread::FlushDeletedGLObjectsOperation(). "

2008-03-04 16:22 +0000 [r7913]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Attached is modified
	  osgShadow::ShadowMap. I changed following things: 1: Shadow map
	  camera sets ABSOLUTE_RF_INHERIT_VIEWPOINT refernce frame. 2:
	  Light Direction by matrix multiplications replaced with
	  transform3x3 multiplication. 3: I made DebugingHUD functional by
	  adding special draw callback. Former version was simply drawing
	  pale square. 4: I was tempted to make 4 th change but decided to
	  not do it. Instead I put it whith #if VIEW_DEPNDENT_TEXGEN. If
	  you decide you may let it go. When objects are not centered at
	  0,0,0 coord but in some distant location (for example at surface
	  of earth ellipsoid) shadow texgen suffers from inadequate
	  precision of float matrices. I changed that by premultiplying
	  Texgen matrix (using OSG double matrices) with inverse modelview
	  and applying it later with ModelView identity matrix. This tweak
	  may be appropriate for OverlayNode texgen as well. I left former
	  version because I suspect that this change will make
	  osgShadow::ShadowMap view dependant. Currently texgen matrix
	  remains the same no matter what View displays it. With my change
	  it wuld be different for each view. This touches the subject of
	  View Dependent Shadow Techniques that J-S asked recently."

2008-03-04 16:03 +0000 [r7912]  robert:

	* Refactored the way that the camera settings are inhertied

2008-03-04 15:29 +0000 [r7911]  robert:

	* From Art Trevs, "in the current implementation of the
	  FrameBufferObject there is a bug. The header file do specify
	  something like this: FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D* target, int
	  zoffset, int level = 0); However in the .cpp file we have:
	  FrameBufferAttachment::FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D* target,
	  int level, int zoffset) Which means that the meaning of level and
	  zoffset is interchanged. The file with the corrected line is
	  attached. Should go into src/osg/ "

2008-03-04 15:10 +0000 [r7910]  robert:

	* From Philip Lowman, "A missing _WIN32_WINNT declaration causes
	  MinGW compilation to fail when reaching FileNameUtils.cpp and the
	  Windows 2000 function GetLongPathName() is called."

2008-03-04 14:19 +0000 [r7909]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay and Robert Osfield, added optional
	  --CompositeViewer path into osgpick to illustrate how to do
	  picking in both viewers and as unit test for picking.

2008-03-04 14:04 +0000 [r7908]  robert:

	* From Art Trevs, add support for saving external shader files.
	  From Robert Osfield, adding missing member variable initializes
	  and Output::getShaderFileNameForOutput() implementation

	* From Paul Martz, a third person view CompositeViewer example

2008-03-04 11:53 +0000 [r7904-7906]  robert:

	* Change the setViewAsLookAt method to use Vec3d rather than Vec3
	  for better precision

	* Changed the updateStateSet code so that it creates a new StateSet
	  each update rather than clear and reuse the existing one, this
	  change fixes a threading issue that occured when the viewer is in
	  DrawThreadPerContext.

	* Removed single threaded setting

2008-03-03 18:12 +0000 [r7903]  robert:

	* From He Sicong, "fixed shader calculation of ray tracing"

2008-02-27 12:11 +0000 [r7891]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski and Robert Osfield, Support from
	  LightPointNode::s/getPointSprite parameter.

2008-02-27 11:46 +0000 [r7888-7890]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Per the discussion in osg-users, this change
	  adds code comments to the Matrix* headers to document assumptions
	  in the getRotate() method."

	* From Paul Martz, fixed get/set methods API

	* Added debug message to track cache usage

2008-02-25 17:30 +0000 [r7887]  robert:

	* From Melchior Franz, fixed handling of modified keys when
	  entering/leaving window

2008-02-25 16:50 +0000 [r7886]  robert:

	* From Franz Melchior, "When switching virtual desktops or
	  minimizing a window, keys remain in pressed state after
	  revealing, even if they are no longer pressed on the keyboard.
	  This can have bad effects, especially if the stuck keys are
	  modifier keys. One has to press and release the stuck keys again
	  to reset the wrong state. The fix keeps track of all key presses
	  and releases. On FocusOut and UnmapNotify it releases all keys
	  that are in pressed state, and on KeymapNotify (following a
	  FocusIn), it sets the currently pressed keys again. To avoid
	  confusion in the OSG-using application normal keys are always
	  reported released /before/ and pressed /after/ modifier keys. As
	  current key states are returned as char[32] keymap by
	  XQueryKeymap and XKeymapEvent, this format is also used to
	  recognize modifier keys and for maintaining the current internal
	  key state. Functions to set/clear/query bits in such a keymap are
	  added. The patch was extensively tested with osgkeyboard and
	  FlightGear under KDE and fvwm2. It was not tested on a Xinerama
	  setup or with multiple windows, but as _eventDisplay is used
	  throughout, there should be no problems. The patch also makes the
	  following changes: - removes old and obsolete handling of
	  modifier keys in ::adaptKey(). This wasn't only unused, but also
	  wrong (and for that reason commented out in revision 7066). The
	  modifier states are actually handled in
	  ./src/osgGA/EventQueue.cpp (EventQueue::keyPress/keyRelease). -
	  fixes some spelling"

2008-02-25 16:26 +0000 [r7885]  robert:

	* From Emmanuel Roche, "I'm joining two zip files to this mail for
	  the modified sources and include files of osgIntrospection. The
	  modifications I made are very small but they are absolutely
	  usefull to use osgIntrospection with visual studio 7.1 or 8 in
	  debug modes. This should also solve other minor common problems
	  (converter memory leak, virtual destructor for PropertyInfo,
	  etc...). I choosed two function names :
	  Reflection::uninitialize() and Type::reset(), this can of course
	  be changed if someone has a better idea... I made the changes
	  against OSG 2.2.0 public release. I tested the result with VS
	  7.1, VS 7.1 SP1, VS 8.0 SP1 and AQTime 5.0 on Windows XP SP2...
	  All 4 seem to agree : they detected memory leaks before and don't
	  anymore. Sorry I haven't take the time to test that on linux but
	  the changes are so small I doubt there could be a problem... I
	  let you check that on your side :-). I hope this will help making
	  OSG an even more wonderfull library."

2008-02-25 16:05 +0000 [r7884]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "I missed a refactoring of the handling of
	  modifier-keys, so they did not work on OS X. Attached you'll find
	  the missing implementation for OS X."

2008-02-25 15:09 +0000 [r7881-7883]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "This change adds "GL_NORMALIZE" and
	  "GL_RESCALE_NORMAL" to .osg IO in place of the hex equivalents."

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Robert Osfield and Carlo Camporesi, took submission from
	  Carlo for adding LoadingExternalReferenceMode to ProxyNode and
	  extended it to include a wider range of options, also completed
	  implementation

2008-02-25 14:27 +0000 [r7880]  robert:

	* Changed method parameter to use const &

2008-02-25 14:15 +0000 [r7879]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "----1---- Attached is a fixed version
	  of OverlayNode.cpp. I fixed CustomPolytope::cut( osg::Plane )
	  method. Bug was apparent in such scenario: Let P1 be some random
	  frustum polytope Let P2 be the polytope that was created from P1
	  bounding box (P2 contains P1 entirely) Then ignoring precision
	  errors: P1.cut( P2 ) == P2.cut( P1 ) == P1. But this condition
	  was not always met. Cut failed when some of the polytope
	  reference points happened to lie exactly on some intersecting
	  planes in both P1 & P2 (plane distance was = 0). I only use
	  CustomPolytope for my shadowing stuff so I did not test how this
	  affects rest of OverlayNode.cpp. ----2---- Also attached is a
	  minor precision improvement for osg::Plane intersect method
	  (double version). ----3---- I have also one observation regarding
	  osg::Plane - There are two intersect vertices methods (float and
	  double flavour): inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3>&
	  vertices) const inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3d>&
	  vertices) const I guess osg::Plane won't compile when someone
	  changes default vec3 typedef to vec3d. Shouldn't the first method
	  be changed to use vec3f explicitly ? Ie: inline int
	  intersect(const std::vector<Vec3f>& vertices) const"

2008-02-25 13:25 +0000 [r7878]  robert:

	* From Glenn Waldron, "As you may recall, we discussed adding
	  ReaderWriter::readObject() overrides to all the image plugins in
	  order to facilitate future archive support. Attached are the
	  necessary modifications. I tested JPEG, but not all the others...
	  the code is identical though. Note that the DDS plugin already
	  contained the readObject() implementations."

2008-02-25 13:17 +0000 [r7876-7877]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Lawandowski, "Fixed
	  EllipsoidModel::computeLocalUpVector to use Vec3d instead of Vec3
	  for normal computation. Its really small issue, maybe not even
	  worth submitting ;-). But one never knows when inadequate
	  precision hits him. "

	* Updated wrappers

2008-02-25 13:07 +0000 [r7875]  robert:

	* Reverted back to previous version of osgtext

2008-02-25 12:54 +0000 [r7874]  robert:

	* Refactored the mutex usage in osgText and freetype plugin to
	  prevent multi-thread crash

2008-02-22 18:38 +0000 [r7873]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I have extended the X11 pbuffer code to
	  use either the complete set of glx 1.3 pbuffer functions or
	  exactly ask for the extensions we need to call the apropriate glx
	  extension functions for and around pbuffers extensions. The glx
	  1.3 version of this functios are prefered. If this is not
	  pressent we are looking for the glx extensions and check for
	  them. Prevously we just used some mix of the glx 1.3 functions or
	  the extension functions without making sure that this extension
	  is present. "

2008-02-22 11:52 +0000 [r7872]  robert:

	* Refactored osgTerrain so that the interface for setting up layer
	  is more straight forward, and added support into
	  GeometryTechnique for handling multiple layers

	* Removed erroneous ;

2008-02-19 12:26 +0000 [r7869]  robert:

	* Changed the updating of the contextID so that the
	  DisplaySetting::MaxNumberOfGrapicsContexts() is updated on each
	  new graphics context creation, in keeping with how osgProducer
	  used to do things.

2008-02-19 11:30 +0000 [r7868]  robert:

	* Refactor the rendering code to not use iterators, instead using
	  indices as means of avoiding using < and += on STL iterators that
	  have shown to be problematic under Windows

2008-02-19 09:49 +0000 [r7867]  robert:

	* From Philip Lowman, workaround for gcc 3.2.3 bug

2008-02-18 15:30 +0000 [r7866]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "Attached you'll find some enhancements by
	  Adrian Egli and me for the carbon-implementation of
	  GraphicsWindow. Now you can use an AGLDrawable in conjunction
	  with osgViewer/osgCompositeViewer." Changes from Robert Osfield,
	  changed std::cout to osg::notify(osg::INFO)

2008-02-18 15:26 +0000 [r7865]  robert:

	* From Rene Molenaar, "Using commandline build system nmake on
	  windows does not work. This is caused by the
	  OSG_MSVC_VERSIONED_DLL hack. there are hard-coded paths to place
	  the dll's in the bin /dir that normally would go in the
	  lib/config (release/debug) dirs. Nmake has different locations
	  for the files (no config dir). fix: change the macro's in
	  OsgMacroUtils.cmake for the IF(NOT MSVC_IDE) situation. Libs go
	  in lib/, and DLLs and executables go in bin/ To accopmplish this
	  for MSVC_IDE the targets get a "../../bin" prefix, for nmake this
	  should be "../bin" (because there are no config folders). This
	  fix mimics the behaviour of the MSCV_IDE (visual studio) build
	  system when building with nmake. Note: A change in the main
	  CMakeLists.txt creates the needed plugin directory in the binary
	  dir. see included files for the changes:
	  r7885fix-v2/CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake
	  r7885fix-v2/osgWrappers/CMakeLists.txt r7885fix-v2/CMakeLists.txt
	  The behaviour of visual studio projects (and other build systems)
	  remain unchanged. Tested building and installing with nmake and
	  visual studio 8 debug and release. "

2008-02-18 15:17 +0000 [r7864]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, "Subject: obj material parse fix this fix strips
	  whitespace off externally referenced material files. fixes a bug
	  where the obj listed something like: mtllib
	  FR_PARIS_ESPACE_UNESCO_S.MTL and then that caused failures in the
	  load later: FindFileInPath() : trying /Users/rpk/Downloads/
	  FR_PARIS_ESPACE_UNESCO_S.MTL ... this fix simply strips
	  whitespace around that filename before passing it on to the
	  remainder of the loader." Changes from Robert Osfield, change
	  std::cout to osg::notify(osg::INFO)

2008-02-18 15:10 +0000 [r7863]  robert:

	* From Thibault Genessay, "On Dec 16 you introduced a fix to remove
	  internal use of ref_ptr<>'s. It contained a bug that would cause
	  freed memory to be written again. Specifically, in
	  FreeTypeLibrary::~FreeTypeLibrary(), calling
	  font->setImplementation(0); deletes the content pointed to by the
	  fontImplementation pointer, while the line the immediately
	  follows tries to access it. My fix is to make the second
	  instruction part of an else clause rather than always executed.
	  This way, the fontImplementation->_facade = 0 instruction is only
	  executed when the font implementation is not set to 0 before
	  (although I have no idea what it is here for and if this code
	  path is ever followed, since I don't know the plugin's internals
	  very well). Attached is the modified FreeTypeLibrary.cpp file."

2008-02-18 15:02 +0000 [r7862]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2008-02-18 14:51 +0000 [r7861]  robert:

	  versions.

2008-02-18 14:14 +0000 [r7860]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, build fix for OSX/gcc 4.0.1

2008-02-18 13:52 +0000 [r7859]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "Here's a fix to the changes regarding the
	  new dispose() function. The last primary node inside a push-pop
	  level would not get the dispose() call. This would result in
	  information from some ancillary records, like the matrix
	  (transform), being lost. Changes are made to the latest version
	  in the repository. Thanks to Terry for the help to find and fix
	  the bug and test the changes."

2008-02-18 13:47 +0000 [r7858]  robert:

	* From Bryan Thrall, "moved the prints to a higher notify level
	  (DEBUG_FP) so they are only printed at the most verbose level."

2008-02-18 13:44 +0000 [r7857]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Attached is a modification to
	  OcclusionQueryNode. The copy constructor was failing to
	  initialize all member variables. This change resolves the issue.

	  by-reference should be initialized. 2) explanatory comments are
	  handy when available as notify() messages."

	* From Mike Weiblen, "an aesthetic enhancement for displaying
	  important version information."

2008-01-28 20:31 +0000 [r7847]  robert:

	* From Glen Waldon, "This change patches ReaderWriterOSGA.cpp so
	  that it passes along the ReaderWriter::Options to files loaded
	  from inside the archive. Previously it was discarding them.
	  example: osgviewer -O noLoadExternalReferenceFiles archive.osga"

	* From Drederic Bouvier, "I noticed the AC3D loader resets database
	  path given as Options, preventing users to put textures in
	  another directory. This patch adds the model path to the path
	  list instead of replacing it."

	* Introduced BUILD_REFERENCE_DOCS option to make it a bit clearer
	  how to enable and build the DoxygenDocs

2008-01-21 12:01 +0000 [r7826-7827]  robert:

	* From Cedric Pinson, "you can find as attachement a readerwriter
	  for ogr files (.tab, .gml, .shp ...) ogr is a part of gdal so i

2008-01-18 20:55 +0000 [r7811]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, Hi Robert -- "as you and J-S and I have been
	  discussing on osg-users, this submission changes the clamp mode

	  older graphics cards, due to use of parameter
	  GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS which is only part of the

	* From Daniel Stien, "When removing a child from a osg::Group,
	  childRemoved is called after the node has already been erased
	  from the node list, causing childRemoved to be performed on the
	  consecutive node. Lines 180 and 182 are swapped in the attached
	  Group.cpp. "

2008-01-11 12:16 +0000 [r7792]  robert:

	* From Adrian Egli, made the getHandled() functionality consistent

	* Fixed date

2008-01-04 20:00 +0000 [r7766]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, "Attached are a few Find modules with updates.
	  Among other things, they contain better support for environmental
	  variables to pre-empt the autodection default search path order
	  which is very helpful for people who do automated builds. (I
	  recommend that the remaining modules consider adding the same
	  system to make things consistent and easier for those people that
	  want to do the automated builds.) The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH has also
	  been added to help people. I don't recommend adding this to the
	  other modules because it looks like CMake agreed with my idea and
	  will be adding the support in 2.6. So when that ships, people
	  will get it for free. (In the meantime, my modules that do have
	  it, it can be used.) Finally, I've submitted all of these modules
	  to official CMake plus more so they will be in the next version
	  of CMake. It looks like I may need to sort some compatibility
	  issues out with the KDE people who seem to have conflicting
	  modules, but this is unrelated to the updates submitted here as
	  OSG already has these conflicts. I figured I would just sync OSG
	  up with my current/best versions. Also of note, I added the large
	  batch of Findosg*.cmake modules to CMake so people building
	  against OpenSceneGraph can use these without writing their own. I
	  wasn't sure if I should submit them here or not since they are
	  for building against OSG and not for building OSG itself. So they
	  are not included. "

2008-01-04 15:33 +0000 [r7764-7765]  robert:

	* From Glenn Waldron, "I found that
	  osg::Sequence::setDuration(speed,reps) was not changing the
	  animation speed factor as expected. The one-line fix (line 312)
	  is attached"

	* From Paul Martz, "Correction to size of reserved filed in .attr

	* From Paul Martz, "The osgocclusionquery example contained some
	  duplicate code that was also in the core OSG occlusion query

	  quicktime plugin from Quicktime/Quicktime.h to
	  QuickTime/QuickTime.h. MacOsX filesystem is normally case
	  insensitive, but in my case I changed that option and the
	  quicktime headers were not found. Now compiles fine and on case
	  insesitive file systems should work correctly too. "

	* From Jason Daly, "I'm still having a problem with SWING
	  animations on sequences. Here's the fix again, merged with this
	  morning's svn (including the other Sequence fixes from J-S)."

2007-12-21 13:32 +0000 [r7726-7727]  robert:

	* From Jeremy Moles, "Here is a implementation of
	  setScreeResolution and setScreenRefreshRate for systems support
	  Xrandr. The include CMakeFile makes this optional, and turns it
	  OFF by default, in which case any person trying to use these
	  functions under Linux will be instructed to build osgViewer w/
	  Xrandr support. "

	* Added return

2007-12-21 13:18 +0000 [r7725]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When using osg::Sequence you can stop
	  the sequence by setting the mode to STOP. Subsequently, you can
	  restart it from the beginning by setting the mode to START. This
	  does not work as expected. The _now time is not updated while the
	  mode is STOP, which causes the items in the sequence to flash by
	  very quickly when the mode is set to START. For example, if the
	  mode was set to STOP and left that way for 30 seconds, and there
	  are 10 items in the sequence, when the mode is set to START all
	  the items will flash by (in 3 loops) while the _now time catches
	  up with the real time, and then the sequence will go on at the
	  rate it should. This is a simple fix for that, which updates the
	  _now time regardless of the mode the sequence is in."

2007-12-21 13:07 +0000 [r7724]  robert:

	* From David Callu, various classes in support of

	* Reset the the _lineSpacing to 0.0f to fix the line spacing when
	  word wrapping takes place

2007-12-20 14:40 +0000 [r7718]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "By complete coincidence I just have
	  read an old OSG submission mail related to bugfixes in
	  osg::Polytope.setToUnitFrustum and setToBoundingBox It was sent
	  at beginning of december. I read it when purging my Thrash emails
	  and found it there this because it was wrongly classified as
	  SPAM. What stroke me in this email was the fact that there was
	  once an error in Polytope class. Since I adopted CustomPolytope
	  (osgSim OverlayNode.cpp) for my minimal shadow area computations
	  I checked my code for this error. And I found it in
	  CustomPolytope::setToUnitFrustum method.
	  CustomPolytope::setToBoundingBox seemed OK. So I went back to the
	  origin and fixed this error in OverlayNode.cpp as well. I have
	  not tested it in OverlayNode though (I don't know how) so please
	  look at this carefully. But it seems to work fine with my shadow
	  calculations."

2007-12-20 10:48 +0000 [r7717]  robert:

	  for setWindowName and useCursor "

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-17 09:58 +0000 [r7707]  robert:

	* From Wojiech Leandowski, "I earlier wrote about my hassles with
	  archives under Windows. I implemented 64 bit binary compatible
	  OSGA archive reader/writer using mixed stdio/iostream calls. But
	  during this work I learned that it can be made in much simpler
	  way. Attached is result of this new attempt. I hope its
	  appropriate for inclusion into OSG codebase. It was compiled and
	  tested with latest SVN OSG, Windows XP 32 bit and Windows Vista
	  business 64 bit. OSG was built using VS 2005 Express SP1 for 32
	  bit environment and VS 2005 Std for 64 bit. --- Solution
	  description (there were two problems involved): --- Problem 1:
	  implicit conversions beetween file positions and 32 bit int. This
	  could be considered a MS compiler bug because this 32 bit int was
	  additionally implicitly converted to/from 64 bit. As far as I
	  know compiler is allowed to make only one implict conversion (but
	  maybe this rule does not refer to simple types). Its actually
	  possible to address OSGA files above 4 GiB range using 32 bit
	  windows iostreams. MS Iostreams in practice offer the same level
	  of functionality as stdio functions. There are functions fsetpos
	  and fgetpos in stdio lib which use 64 bit file pointers (fpos_t).
	  These functions are internally called by seekp( streampos ),
	  seekg( streampos ), tellp(), and tellg() methods. So its also
	  possible to change and retrieve file postions using iostream
	  calls. But the problem lies in implicit handling of streampos
	  type. streampos type is actually a template class used as seekp,
	  seekg parameter and returnd from tellp, tellg. Its capable of
	  storing 64 bit file pointers. But streampos can be also converted
	  to/from simple type streamoff. It has proper constructor and cast
	  operator. In Win 32 environment streamoff is defined as long (~32
	  bit int). So when seekp, and tellp arent used with exact
	  streampos objects but OSGA_Archive::pos_type complier makes
	  implicit casts to 32 bit int types loosing important bits of
	  information. So above problem could be easily handled by making
	  conversion calls explicit. My code defines 2 functions used to
	  convert back and forth beetwen 64 bit OSGA_Archive::pos_type and
	  std::streampos objects: OSGA_Archive::pos_type ARCHIVE_POS( const
	  std::streampos & pos ); std::streampos STREAM_POS(
	  OSGA_Archive::pos_type & pos ); Rest of the OSGA implementation
	  code was modified to call these conversions explicitly with
	  seekp, seekg, tellp, tellg. --- Problem 2: seekp and seekg have
	  two variants. Only one of these variants is actually 64 bit
	  proof. When I solved my first problem and made use of explicit
	  streampos conversion functions, OSGA archive was able to read my
	  example 11 GiB archive. But there were still problems with write
	  and append. I found that the reason for this was pair of seekp(
	  0, std::ios_base::end ) and tellp() calls. It turned out that use
	  of seekp, seekg( offset, direction ) function variants was
	  setting file pos pointer to EOF when file was larger than 4GiB.
	  But I noticed that one arg seekp, seekg ( streampos ) versions
	  worked correctly. So the solution was to change OSGA write logic
	  a little, and replace seekp( offset, direction ) with seekp(
	  absolute_pos ) calls. I achieved this by modifing IndexBlock
	  write method to record and restore file pos after IndexBlock was
	  written. This modification has the effect that put pointer is
	  generally kept at the end of file, so there is no need to
	  repostion to the end before writing the files. This allowed me to
	  get rid of those problematic seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end )
	  calls. There was one place where I could not easily get rid of
	  seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ). It was situation where existing
	  OSGA was opened for appending. I resolved this by computing file
	  length by finding max position from index block and file block
	  endings. Then I replaced former seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end )
	  with seekp( STREAM_POS( found_file_length ). --- Description of
	  these changes may sound bit hacky but in practice these were
	  fairly simple and straightforward modifications. I hope they pass
	  your review. There is one complex preprocessor condition which I
	  based on few lines taken from boost positioning.hpp. Boost
	  licence does allow such reproduction. In case of problems this
	  condition may be easily simplified to windows only
	  implementation. "

2007-12-16 17:57 +0000 [r7706]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Some clients at my new job noticed
	  that picking did not work with the osg::Capsule subclass of
	  osg::Shape in an osg::ShapeDrawable. Other shapes worked fine. So
	  I have fixed this. Code attached. My modification is in the
	  PrimitiveShapeVisitor, and is based on the DrawShapeVisitor - I
	  added methods called createCylinderBody and createHalfSphere, and
	  used them in apply(Cylinder&) and apply(Capsule&). In my testing
	  they work fine, tested even with transforms and moving around the
	  scene. "

2007-12-16 17:53 +0000 [r7705]  robert:

	* Added check to make set up a sequencegroup only happen when
	  required.

2007-12-16 17:46 +0000 [r7704]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "osgSim::BlinkSequence has
	  sequenceGroup unitialized by default (=NULL ref_ptr). By looking
	  at the code I figured out that unset sequenceGroup is completely
	  correct and thus allowed. But writing BlinkSequence with empty
	  sequence group caused a crash when IVE was accessing baseTime
	  from NULL address. Atttached is a fix for this situation. "

2007-12-16 17:41 +0000 [r7703]  robert:

	* From Wojiech Lewandowski, "There was a bug in ShadowMap camera
	  view matrix computation. View matrix was wrong when light was
	  directional and shadowed scene was not centered at zero coord. I
	  fixed that and also modified cast distance to much smaller value.
	  With former range it was possible to generate shadows with lowest
	  LODs. "

2007-12-12 17:04 +0000 [r7679]  robert:

	* From Serge Lages, introduce readRef*File() methods which pass
	  back ref_ptr<> rather than C pointers.

2007-12-12 16:56 +0000 [r7677-7678]  robert:

	* Updated copyright notices

	* From Andy Skinner, build fixes for Solaris.

2007-12-12 11:57 +0000 [r7676]  robert:

	* Added std:: infront of sort call

2007-12-12 10:47 +0000 [r7675]  robert:

	* Added const to operators.

2007-12-12 10:35 +0000 [r7674]  robert:

	* Added std:: in front of find enties

2007-12-12 09:48 +0000 [r7673]  robert:

	* From Serge Lages, "Here is a new modification to CMake adding an
	  option (OSG_MSVC_GENERATE_PLUGINS_AND_WRAPPERS_MANIFESTS) to
	  specify if we want to generate or not the manifest files under
	  VS8 for the plugins and the wrappers. It seems that the manifests
	  are needed if we try to load dynamically a core OSG dll."

2007-12-12 09:45 +0000 [r7672]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Function declaration returns a bool, function
	  body was returning a pointer. Changed body to return (pointer !=
	  NULL)."

2007-12-11 17:19 +0000 [r7671]  robert:

	* From Cyril Brulebois, removed redundent typedef.

2007-12-11 17:01 +0000 [r7670]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-11 16:42 +0000 [r7669]  robert:

	* From Brede Johnansen, support for continuation records.

2007-12-11 16:34 +0000 [r7668]  robert:

	* From Karl Heijdenberg, moved set/getFrameStamp() from
	  osgViewer::View to osg::View.

2007-12-11 15:55 +0000 [r7667]  robert:

	* From Mike Garrity, "There was an on again/off again thread on OSG
	  users about creating subclasses of osg::Array that referenced
	  data stored an application's internal data structures. I took a
	  stab at implementing that and ran into a couple of downcasts in
	  Geometry.cpp. Enclosed is my take at fixing those along with a
	  simple example of how to do this."

2007-12-11 14:48 +0000 [r7666]  robert:

	* Added missing copyright notices

2007-12-11 14:39 +0000 [r7665]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a change to the PBuffer
	  initialsation code that checks for the GLX version before issuing
	  commands that require GLX-1.3. This prevents a crash with open
	  source drivers on linux. "

2007-12-11 14:06 +0000 [r7664]  robert:

	* From Roger James, "The changes are as follows:- 1. DAE object no
	  longer held onto by plugin. 2. Filename to URI conversion now
	  handled internally by plugin. 2. User can supply an external DAE
	  object for use by the plugin. 3. User can supply a std:string
	  object for the plugin to return the URI of the document just
	  processed. 4. User can supply a std::string to receive the unit
	  name information from the document just read in. (e.g. meters,
	  inches, etc.) 5. User can supply a float to receive the metric
	  conversion factor from the document just read in. 6. User can
	  supply an enum to receive the up axis orientation information
	  from the document just read in. 7. Material transparency can be
	  both read and written. 8. User can supply an experimental
	  GoogleMode option on output. The plugin will try to emulate the
	  way Sketchup specifies transparency (i.e. the inverse of what it
	  should be!). I am still struggling to get GE to understand
	  transparency, anyone know what it expects? 9. Rudimentary support
	  for Collada effect parameters (newparam, setparam, param) on
	  input. Basic nVidia FX Composer dae documents can now be read. "

2007-12-11 12:35 +0000 [r7662-7663]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Tim More, "This submission tries to optimize redundant
	  compilation of StateSets and Drawables in the DatabasePager. The
	  practical effects of these are to greatly reduce startup time and
	  the time to load an individual scenery tile in FlightGear. - From
	  my log message: Minimize the number of StateSets and drawables
	  that are compiled by checking if they have already been compiled
	  or will be elminated by the SharedStateManager. Move the sorting
	  of the dataToCompile queue out of compileGLObjects into the man
	  pager run function. Change the SharedStateManager to use maps
	  instead of vectors."

2007-12-11 11:57 +0000 [r7660-7661]  robert:

	* From Joseph Steel, "he change is to initializeExtensionProcs() to
	  verify the version of the OpenGL implementation before attempting
	  to get the MaxTextureCoords parameter."

	* From Mathias Froelich, "I have cleaned up the state set handling
	  of the osg::ClipNode. Previously the complete StateSet was
	  cleared, even the non clipping releted state attributes and modes
	  in this stateset on a call to setLocalSetateSetModes. With this
	  change only those modes/attributes are changed that need to be
	  changed. That is, if a clip plane is removed from the ClipNode,
	  only this assiciated mode is removed from the state set, instead
	  of throwing away the whole state set. In this way we have less
	  surprising results if the state set of a clip node is used for
	  more state than just the clip state. "

2007-12-11 11:42 +0000 [r7659]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froechlich, "I have extended the StateSet api with a
	  StateSet::removeAssociatedModes(const StateAttribute*) and a
	  StateSet::removeAssociatedTextureModes(unsigned, const
	  StateAttribute*) call. These funktions are just missing for a
	  complete api IMO."

2007-12-11 11:37 +0000 [r7658]  robert:

	* From Alberto Luaces, "it seems that include/osgParticle/BoxPlacer
	  was created from the SectorPlacer file. The code works well but
	  the SectorPlacer comments stayed in the new file. I have altered
	  those comments so they now contain valid information for the
	  BoxPlacer class and the doxygen generated documentation is
	  correct. "

2007-12-11 11:21 +0000 [r7657]  robert:

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix allowing removal of shaders
	  from a program after it is first compiled. It will also allow new
	  shaders to be attached after the program is first compiled."

2007-12-10 20:56 +0000 [r7656]  robert:

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "In ESRIShapeParser.cpp, wasn't closing the
	  file handle. Added: if(fd) { close(fd); fd = 0; } to the
	  constructor."

2007-12-10 20:36 +0000 [r7653-7655]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, "For osgviewerCocoa, a very simple change to
	  allow toggling between fullscreen mode and back between views.
	  (To activate, double click on the view to toggle.) It
	  demonstrates/uses the new one-liner fullscreen method introduced
	  in Leopard. Code will still compile and run in pre-Leopard
	  (thanks to Obj-C dynamic/late binding), but code path is treated
	  as a no-op in those cases."

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Richard Schmidt, fix on ordering to be standard OpenGL way.

2007-12-10 20:30 +0000 [r7651-7652]  robert:

	* From Richard Schmidt, "attached you will find a set of small
	  fixes and features. CullVisitor/SceneView: *Feature: This version
	  supports multiple clearnodes in the graph, one per renderstage.
	  Text: *Feature: Performance Enhancement when calling
	  SetBackdropColor Material: *Fix: OpenGL calls are now made
	  according to the OpenGL Standard "

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "attached are some fixes and tweaks I made
	  to the .obj loader: - Material class contained both 'shininess'
	  and 'Ns' member variables - 'Ns' and 'Ni' are initialized to 0
	  ('Ni' is unused at the moment) - only 'Ns' was read from .mtl
	  file but 'shininess' was used for osg::Material - 'illum' was
	  read from .mtl file but never used; it is now used as follows --
	  illum==0 -> no osg::Material created/attached therefore no
	  lighting -- illum==1 -> osg::Material specular is set to black --
	  illum==2 (default) -> specular read from .mtl file is used -
	  'map_Kd' and 'map_Ks' may contain additional arguments (e.g. '-s
	  1 1 1'), these are now skipped over and the texture filename is
	  properly extracted "

2007-12-10 19:51 +0000 [r7649-7650]  robert:

	* From David Callu, IO support for Text3D

	* From David Callu, Text3D

2007-12-10 17:30 +0000 [r7648]  robert:

	* From Roland Smeenk, "Attached you will find a large set of small
	  typo fixes (mainly in the comments)."

2007-12-10 16:21 +0000 [r7647]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-10 16:14 +0000 [r7646]  robert:

	* Added osgViewerGetVersion() usage to force Windows to link
	  osgViewer.

2007-12-10 15:15 +0000 [r7645]  robert:

	* From David Callu, added support of 3D text to osgText and
	  associated plugins.

2007-12-10 12:45 +0000 [r7644]  robert:

	* From David Callu, added support for automatically reading
	  associate dbase files

2007-12-10 12:00 +0000 [r7643]  robert:

	* Char char[] to char* with new allocation.

2007-12-10 11:34 +0000 [r7642]  robert:

	* Refactored record allocation to fix build errors under Windows.

2007-12-10 11:20 +0000 [r7641]  robert:

	* Added export macro for windows build

2007-12-10 10:16 +0000 [r7640]  robert:

	* Added include<string.h> to fix compile errors under gcc 4.3

2007-12-09 16:38 +0000 [r7639]  robert:

	* From Gustavo Wagner, fixed bugs in reading M records from
	  shapefile

2007-12-09 16:29 +0000 [r7638]  robert:

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've added the following features to
	  the OSG VRML plugin: * Support for Box, Sphere, Cone, and
	  Cylinder. These nodes are converted to osg::Geometry conform the
	  VRML97 spec. * Backface culling is enabled/disabled according to
	  the "solid" flag for geometries that are converted from
	  IndexFaceSets. * PROTO instances can now be used for "appearance"
	  and "geometry" fields in a Shape node. The file
	  ReaderWriterVRML2.cpp is adapted for the latest stable public
	  release:
	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/svn/osg/OpenSceneGraph/tags/OpenSceneGraph-2.2.0
	  The changes where needed for being able to read VRML file which
	  are output by VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). A
	  sample VRML file is enclosed in this submission. The plugin has
	  been tested against a number of VRML samples that include
	  texturing. The texturing is found to be VRML97 compliant for all
	  added geometry nodes. "

2007-12-09 16:23 +0000 [r7637]  robert:

	* Removed redundent OpenFlightOptimizer

2007-12-09 16:14 +0000 [r7636]  robert:

	* From Ralf Karn, fixed "invalid enumerant" warning on
	  TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY_EXT initialization

2007-12-09 16:06 +0000 [r7635]  robert:

	* From Mihai Radu, "After someone asked for a fix for non-textured
	  object appearing black with the shader for textured objects. This
	  works very well in cases where there could be a mix of textured
	  and non-textured objects in the scene, and it makes the
	  initialization more robust. The idea is from PSSM, to add a
	  1pixel texture to the main rendering as to provide white for any
	  objects missing textures."

2007-12-09 16:01 +0000 [r7634]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-09 15:43 +0000 [r7633]  robert:

	* From David Callu, added DBase attribute support for shapefiles

2007-12-09 14:54 +0000 [r7632]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-09 12:19 +0000 [r7631]  robert:

	* From Aderian Egli, changed the window dimension clamping code to
	  work independantly for width and height.

2007-12-08 17:10 +0000 [r7630]  robert:

	* From Mario Guimaraes, "Currently, in the StateSet::merge method,
	  the rhs state attributes and modes are not merged into the lhs
	  state when the rhs is PROTECTED. The changes I'm providing here
	  address this problem."

2007-12-08 17:04 +0000 [r7629]  robert:

	* From Serge Lages, "Hi Robert, You were right about the
	  CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS option for CMake, so here is a
	  modification allowing to not generate the manifest files for the
	  plugins making them a lot more easy to redistribute. I have also
	  made the same modification to the wrappers as they are also put
	  into the osgPlugin folder when generated. "

2007-12-08 17:00 +0000 [r7628]  robert:

	* from Paul Matz, "Understood. Well, I think it's reasonable to
	  assume that the non-env var case is the more tested case, and
	  therefore it is correct to set _supportsVertexBufferObjects to
	  the same value as _fastPath. So here's a change that does the
	  same thing for the env var case."

2007-12-08 16:52 +0000 [r7627]  robert:

	* From Jeremy Moles, Anders Backman and Robert Osfield, both Jeremy
	  and Anders added static build support as an option, but one was
	  for Unix and one for Windowsm, but the two mods were also
	  inconsitent in naming and implementation. I have had a bash at
	  merging them both, but don't know yet if these changes will work
	  yet on either configuration... user testing will tell...

2007-12-08 16:37 +0000 [r7626]  robert:

	* From Peter Hrenka, "Due to popular demand I would like to submit
	  this enhanced version of PolytopeIntersector. New features of
	  PolytopeIntersector : * Dimension mask: The user may specify the
	  dimensions of the primitives to be tested. Checking
	  polytope-triangle and polytope-quad intersections is rather slow
	  so this can be turned off. * Reference plane: The resulting
	  intersections are sorted by the distance to this plane. New
	  memebers of PolytopeIntersector::Intersection : * distance:
	  Distance of localIntersectionPoint to the reference plane *
	  maxDistance: Maximum distance of all intersectionPoints to the
	  reference plane. * intersectionPoints: The points intersecting
	  the planes of the polytope or points completely inside the
	  polytope. * localIntersectionPoint: arithmetic mean of all
	  intersection points * primitiveIndex: Index of the primitive that
	  intersected I added some more output to the example
	  osgkeyboardmouse."

2007-12-08 15:46 +0000 [r7625]  robert:

	* From David Cullu and Robert Osfield, David addded a new style of
	  OSG integration with QT by sublcassing from QTWidget and using
	  osgViewer to create the graphics context, Robert added
	  integration of this codes with the original AdapterWidget
	  implementation still available by default. The new implementation
	  can be accessed by running: osgviewerQT cow.osg --QOSGWidget

2007-12-08 15:32 +0000 [r7624]  robert:

	* From Daniel Larimer, "There was a error with QTUtils.h when
	  compiling on HFS case-sensitive file system. The
	  #include<Quicktime/Quicktime.h> line needs to be replaced with
	  #include<QuickTime/QuickTime.h"

2007-12-08 15:27 +0000 [r7623]  robert:

	* From Neil Hughes, "Please find attached a replacement for the 3DS
	  pluggin's ReaderWriter3DS.cpp file. This contains a minor fix
	  (one line added) to ensure that the OSG Material structure is
	  given the name of the material definition within a loaded 3DS
	  file. "

2007-12-08 15:08 +0000 [r7622]  robert:

	* From Donald Cipperly, Fixed memory leak in computeIntersections

2007-12-08 15:04 +0000 [r7621]  robert:

	* From Jeremy Moles, "This extra call to SDL_VideoSetMode()
	  prevents my viewport from getting all wonky when I resize the SDL
	  window. I'm not sure if this bug has always existed or not, but
	  according to the SDL documentation this operation should be safe
	  regardless, and doesn't not introduce the need for extra memory
	  management (that is: there is no need to "cleanup" the old screen
	  variable, that is all handled by SDL for us). "

2007-12-08 13:29 +0000 [r7620]  robert:

	* From Robert Osfield and Richard Schmidt, made fixes inspired by
	  an original submission from Richard which highlighted problems
	  with Light, ClipPlane and Hint usage in osg::State's usage of
	  cloneType and reassignment of target/num in StateSet/these
	  StateAttributes.

2007-12-08 12:12 +0000 [r7619]  robert:

	* From David Callu, added IO_FluidProgram implementation.

2007-12-07 13:42 +0000 [r7618]  robert:

	* Added an #include<assert.h> to avoid compile problems on some
	  systems.

2007-12-07 13:28 +0000 [r7617]  robert:

	* From Tony Horrobin, "Attached is a small fix for the openflight
	  loader with regard to road segment and construction records. It
	  just uses the id field to set the name of the osg node as with
	  other types."

2007-12-07 13:19 +0000 [r7616]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, minor typo fixes in notify messages

2007-12-06 17:53 +0000 [r7615]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, added extra event handlers

2007-12-06 17:44 +0000 [r7614]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The bmp writer crashes in certain cases.
	  It happens when the computed size of the image data is greater
	  than the actual image size. This causes the memcpy call to go out
	  of the array bounds. I modified the code so that it copies the
	  data during the iteration, instead of memcpy'ing. This fixes the
	  problems i was having. If you are curious, the writer was
	  crashing when trying to write an RGB image that was 2050 x 1280.
	  You might be able to reproduce it by allocating an empty image of
	  that size and writing it to a file."

2007-12-06 17:41 +0000 [r7613]  robert:

	* From Hautio Jari, "Current version of GraphicsWindowWin32 allows
	  resize to zero height window. This breaks rendering in for
	  example MFC SDI applications and in MFC MDI applications if user
	  resizes the window so that client area has zero height. Current
	  safeguard for minimized window: LRESULT
	  GraphicsWindowWin32::handleNativeWindowingEvent( HWND hwnd, UINT
	  uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam ) ... ///////////////// case
	  WM_MOVE : case WM_SIZE : ///////////////// ... if
	  (clientRect.bottom==0 && clientRect.right==0) ... does not cover
	  this situation. In these situations clientRect.bottom = 0 and
	  clientRect.right > 0. Quick fix to this is relax condition: if
	  (clientRect.bottom==0 || clientRect.right==0) Modified file is
	  attached. Tested with osgviewerMFC from 2.2.0 release (Windows XP
	  sp2) Before fix: - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe
	  cow.osg. - the cow is rendered nicely. - resize window to zero
	  height by dragging from bottom border upwards. - resize window
	  back to original height - just blue screen, no cow After fix: -
	  execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg. - the cow is
	  rendered nicely. - resize window to zero height by dragging from
	  bottom border upwards. - resize window back to original height -
	  the cow is where it is supposed to be. "

2007-12-06 17:31 +0000 [r7611-7612]  robert:

	* From Serge Lages, "Here are some modifications to the
	  DatabasePager, with the possibility to : - Get or set the target
	  number of PagedLOD children to remove per frame. - Get or set the
	  minimum number of inactive PagedLOD to keep. Corresponding
	  environment variables have been added too. The default values
	  reproduce the previous DatabasePager behavior."

	* From Cedric Pinson, fixes for toggle fullscreen on gnome desktop

2007-12-06 17:07 +0000 [r7610]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "n examples/osgfadetext/CMakeLists.txt
	  osgSim as dependency is missing."

2007-12-06 17:03 +0000 [r7608-7609]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Add missing includes. Fails on hp-ux."

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a changed version of
	  osgunittests.cpp. The __FUNCTION__ macro/string value is not
	  portable. Instead the functions name is just put into the
	  string."

2007-12-06 16:50 +0000 [r7607]  robert:

	* From Wojiech Leandowski, fixed the hardwiring of archive
	  extensions to 4 charaters

2007-12-06 10:04 +0000 [r7606]  robert:

	* Fixed crash in cfg by rearranging the code blocks so the codes
	  that use the graphics context are only called when a graphics
	  context is successfully aquired.

2007-12-06 09:22 +0000 [r7605]  robert:

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, added osgViewer dependency for OSX build

2007-12-05 18:32 +0000 [r7604]  robert:

	* Changed WIN32 guard to _WIN32_IMPLEMENTATION to attempt to avoid
	  Win32 build error

2007-12-05 11:29 +0000 [r7603]  robert:

	* Removed debugging line.

2007-12-05 11:23 +0000 [r7602]  robert:

	* From Cedric Pinson, first cut at Producer .cfg camera
	  configuration file support.

2007-12-04 14:46 +0000 [r7597-7601]  robert:

	* Added support for new double Vec*Array classes in various
	  functors.

	* Added optional double support via new Vec3dArray support in
	  osg::Geometry. To enable double usage set the option string
	  "double" i.e. osgviewer myshapefile.shf -O "double"

	* Added support for double Vec*Array objects

	* Added double Vec*Array support

	* Added testPolytope entry

2007-12-01 15:30 +0000 [r7596]  robert:

	* Fixed the Polytop::setFrustum and setBoundingBox method

2007-11-21 10:18 +0000 [r7595]  robert:

	* Added a check against the makeCurrent() return type to make sure
	  that OpenGL calls are only made if the makeCurrent() is
	  successful.

2007-11-17 11:50 +0000 [r7594]  robert:

	* From Colin Dunlop, add --devices support.

2007-11-13 17:03 +0000 [r7593]  robert:

	  reading/writing.

2007-11-10 03:43 +0000 [r7592]  ewing:

	* Added missing files for qt plugin

2007-11-09 20:04 +0000 [r7591]  ewing:

	* For osgdb_freetype: Ugh. Another fix for the cycle problem. It
	  seems that the SDKROOT didn't necessarily solve the problem, but
	  there were some unneeded library dependencies that weren't in my
	  test fork which allowed my test to work, but caused SVN to fail.
	  I have removed some of the excess libraries and it seems to build
	  without the Q&A fix.

2007-11-09 13:16 +0000 [r7590]  ewing:

	* Updated version for 2.1.15 dev release

2007-10-03 23:03 +0000 [r7551-7552]  robert:

	* From Panagiotis Papadakos, "Setting the maximum height of osgText
	  doen't seem to work. If the text is big enough, it exceeds the
	  height that I gave as input to setMaximumHeight. So check if
	  cursor is out of -_maximumHeight."

	* Added support for defining an option
	  OSG_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT within the CMake build system,
	  enabling this option will build the OSG against the (...) version
	  of the tesselation callback functions. One can also set the
	  default value of this option via the
	  DEFAULT_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT variable that is set locally
	  to OFF for all platforms except AIX and OSX, but can be overriden
	  by setting it via command line option i.e. cmake .
	  -DDDEFAULT_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT=ON

2007-10-03 21:12 +0000 [r7550]  shuber:

	* updated XCode projects

2007-10-03 20:21 +0000 [r7549]  robert:

	* Added GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT path into include/osg/GLU and
	  enabled this for AIX as reading the old paths this was required.
	  This looks like it is needed under Xcode build as well.

	* From Alberto Luaces, build fix for Cygwin.

2007-10-03 08:34 +0000 [r7541]  robert:

	* Added return 0 to fix warning

2007-10-02 21:45 +0000 [r7539-7540]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Mihair Radu, "Most of the additions are small utility
	  methods: - set the resolution of the shadow map; it calls dirty()
	  to re-initialize at next update - keep a list of Shader objects
	  to use instead of the default ones, if the list is empty, the
	  default shaders are used - explicitly create the Uniform
	  variables, so that subsequent additions that require more
	  Uniforms can put them in a central place - set a Light or
	  LightSource to use explicitly for shadow casting, allows multiple
	  lights in the scene, with one casting shadows There are two
	  additions that do not ( yet ) function correctly, but in the
	  present usage they do not interfere with the regular usage of the
	  techique: - support for using spotlights, it's using
	  Light.spotCutoff to determine if it's a spot-light and not
	  point-light, there is an error in the setup of either the shadow
	  camera or the texgen, most likely due to the direction of the
	  spotlight, since the position is being used just like in point or
	  directional lights. - creation of a debugHUD the hud is created
	  properly, ( the example included shows it ), but it displays only
	  white, there has been some discussion of displaying the shadow
	  map, but I could not find it, the addition of a simple fragment
	  shader with the appropriate color transform should get this
	  going."

2007-10-02 21:28 +0000 [r7535-7538]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Introduced a OSG_PLUGIN_PREFIX variable into CMake build system
	  with it set to "" for all platforms except Cygwin where its set
	  to "cygwin_" and Mingw where it is set to "mingw_". Updated
	  osgDB::Registry to look for these for the plugins. Updated the
	  osgintrospection example to search for these names as well.

	* Updated to reflect new CompositeViewer threading models

	* Merged the threading set up and rendering code from Viewer and
	  CompositeViewer into ViewerBase to allow CompositeViewer to
	  inherit the same theading models previously just supported by
	  osgViewer::Viewer

2007-10-02 20:56 +0000 [r7532-7534]  robert:

	* Changed the search for Qt version to prevent problems when having
	  both Qt3 and Qt4 installed on one machine.

	* Added a #ifdef 0 code block to test setting of the
	  StateSetManipulator's DataVariance to DYNAMIC to solve a
	  threading issue relating to mixing of StateSetManipulator and
	  DrawThreadPerContext.

	* Changed the GLU_TESS_CALLBACK in an attempt to avoid compile
	  problems under OSX.

2007-10-02 20:45 +0000 [r7531]  robert:

	* From Andy Skinner, changes the library linkage to just include

2007-10-01 08:50 +0000 [r7521]  robert:

	* Removed log2 and replaced the places where is was used with a new

	* Updated wrappers

2007-09-30 19:53 +0000 [r7518]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "here's the osgDB::Registry changes to add
	  Options to the read*File() interface. As we discussed, this
	  preserves the old interface for backwards compatibility. osgconv
	  also changed to use the new Registry::writeNode() interface. No
	  other applications or examples were affected."

2007-09-30 19:39 +0000 [r7517]  robert:

	  Viewer

2007-09-30 18:43 +0000 [r7513-7514]  robert:

	* Added hdwriter to CMake build

	* From David Spilling, "Please find attached an extension of the
	  Radiance HDR (RGBE) image reader to support writing. The options
	  are intended to match the existing read options. By default it
	  will only write RGB32F format; if the "RAW" option is selected,
	  it will output 8 bit RGBA as "raw" RGBE. Note also that the
	  writer inserts a flipVertical(); although the RGBE format,
	  according to spec, should support top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top
	  ordering, no software I've found, including that from the formats
	  originator, actually respects this."

2007-09-30 18:33 +0000 [r7512]  robert:

	* From Jan Peciva, "I am submitting improved Inventor (iv) writer.
	  List of changes: - added support for Billboards and LOD -
	  improved Material handling "

2007-09-30 16:24 +0000 [r7511]  shuber:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-09-30 15:07 +0000 [r7508-7509]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Dan Minor, "osgText::Text does not currently have a
	  getAxisAlignment method. The attached code adds this, along with
	  a member variable to keep track of the setting. It is based on
	  the latest subversion version, and was tested by creating a new
	  text object with the same axis alignment as an existing one (e.g.
	  new_text->setAxisAlignment(old_text->getAxisAlignment()); )."
	  From Robert Osfield, " I originally didn't add a
	  getAxisAlignment() as all setAxisAlignment does is set the
	  Rotation member variable, and potentially one could apply user
	  defined Rotation setting after the setAxisAlignment() which would
	  bring it out of sync with the setAxisAlignment. Rather than
	  reject your submission on the ground of potentially getting out
	  of sync and therefore misleading users I've added a
	  USED_DEFINED_ROTATION to AxisAlignment enum, and set this in the
	  serRotation and then override this setting of _axisAlignment in
	  the setAxisAlingment method. I've also removed the lazy updating
	  optimization you've added to the top of setAxisAlignment to avoid
	  potential problems as well."

2007-09-30 11:37 +0000 [r7507]  robert:

	* Moved ViewerBase class out into its own header and source file.
	  Improved the support for stats collection in
	  CompositeViewer/StatsHandler.

	  StatsHandler

2007-09-29 11:12 +0000 [r7504]  robert:

	* From Mattias Linde, "Nice, this almost gets the job done, one way
	  communication into the plugin is possible. I've done some
	  additional small modification regarding constness in ReaderWriter
	  and added mutable on _pluginData so passing data back would be
	  possible too. Have updated the collada plugin
	  (ReaderWriterDAE.cpp) to use the map to handle options and have
	  attached the changes. The stuff in daeReader.h and daeWriter.h
	  are just cosmetic changes to get rid of a warning."

2007-09-28 13:42 +0000 [r7503]  robert:

	* Fixed SphericalDisplay set up codes to properly manage display
	  host/num

2007-09-28 13:38 +0000 [r7501-7502]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I had a chance to look into the remote
	  display problems. The screen resolution was queried for the wrong
	  display."

	* From Mattias Linde, "I've attached a modified ReaderWriter header
	  which has some additions to osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options to
	  handle PluginData."

2007-09-28 08:53 +0000 [r7499-7500]  robert:

	* Andre Garneau, three fixes in one submissions: "This is a fix for
	  the issue reported by Anders a week ago (see \u201c[osg-users]
	  BUG?: mouse coordinate changes after window move\u201d discussion
	  thread on Sept. 20). The issue was that the initial
	  implementation added a few months back was not converting the
	  window coordinates to client-area coordinates resulting in a
	  slight offset each time a decorated window was moved (caused by
	  the window border). This was also causing windows to move out of
	  their assigned screen." and "Attached is a fix for the taskbar
	  repaint issue that occurs when a graphics window is toggled from
	  full-screen mode to windowed mode (as identified by Gert van
	  Maren a couple of weeks ago). Also included is a fix derived from
	  the \u201cEvents from the past\u201d discussion thread that took
	  place on July 11."

	* Added record path manipulator

2007-09-27 13:49 +0000 [r7498]  robert:

	* Changed across to using a GraphicsOperation as the base class for
	  the RealizeOperation.

2007-09-27 12:47 +0000 [r7497]  robert:

	* From Adrian Egli, "update the PSSM, i did some bug fixes and
	  added new features to move the camera virtual against the view
	  direction by applaying a simple distance factor (a), which is
	  calculated camera eye - camera center distance. and we can move
	  the "light camera" against the light direction (b). (a) some
	  objects behind the camera can cast shadow (b) object aboive the
	  camera can cast shadow then i fixed the shadow map orientation,
	  now screen x coordinate alinged which improve the quality"

2007-09-27 12:15 +0000 [r7496]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, compile fix for HP-UX without large file
	  support

2007-09-27 10:47 +0000 [r7495]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Some more file that needs some
	  adjustment because of missing member templates in suns stl."

2007-09-27 10:42 +0000 [r7494]  robert:

	* Changed copy constrcutor to a default constrcutor and std::copy
	  to avoid problems with dodge Sun compiler.

	* Tweaked the wrapping of osgViewer::Scene to fix build problems

2007-09-26 10:58 +0000 [r7485]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a first implementation
	  for the obj-plugin to write obj-files. It is not feature complete
	  but usable. Known issues: * not all materials are handled
	  correctly (especially when using osg::StateAttribute::OVERRIDE),
	  not all properties are supported * could not test point and
	  lines, all of my programs which are capable to read obj-files
	  only import triangle-meshes. * only simple texture-handling"

	  project for OpenSceneGraph 2.1.11. The one supplied in the
	  archive does not build due to some missing file references."

2007-09-24 09:35 +0000 [r7457]  robert:

	* From Jose Delport: "have been using the new
	  VIEW_DEPENDENT_WITH_ORTHOGRAPHIC_OVERLAY mode of the OverlayNode.
	  I change the overlay subgraph dynamically and when I remove all
	  the subgraph nodes that is inside the current main camera FOV
	  (others outside still exist), the overlay texture does not update
	  because of the early return in the traversal. I then get a kind
	  of ghost texture moving around the terrain. The attached file
	  fixed the problem for me, but I'm not sure if it is the best way
	  to address the problem."

2007-09-24 09:26 +0000 [r7456]  robert:

	* From David Spilling, "Given no replies to my recent "does anybody
	  use the DDS writer" query, I was emboldened to submit this very
	  small patch. The bitmasks for RGBA and RGB have been modified in
	  the writer portion of the code (line 765 onwards). This is now
	  consistent with what the DDS plugin reads. In terms of testing,
	  note that many 3rd party applications erroneously ignore the
	  bitmasks in the file, and assume a BGRA order."

2007-09-11 13:42 +0000 [r7389-7390]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Mathias Froenlich, "have a problem with the SunOS CC. It
	  does not like that the prototype of ClipNode::setStateSetModes()
	  differs from implementation of that function in the constness of
	  the second parameter. On SunOS it compiles fine, but I get link
	  errors when the variant that is declared in the header is
	  referenced. The attached src/osg/ClipNode.cpp file removes the
	  const qualifier from the implementation to match exactly the
	  prototype in the header file. The file is based on revision 7386
	  as of today. "

2007-09-11 13:34 +0000 [r7387-7388]  robert:

	* From Art Trevs, "File Changes: - GL2Extensions, Program and
	  Program.cpp Features: - Support for fragment output binding.
	  (e.g. You can now specify in the fragment shader varying out vec3
	  fragOut; fragOut = vec3(1,0,1); to write to the fragOut variable.
	  In your program you call glBindFragDataLocation(program, 1,
	  "fragOut") to bind the fragOut variable with the MRT 1 -
	  GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1_EXT) - new methods
	  Program::add/removeBindFragDataLocation
	  Program::getFragDataBindingList "

	* Seperated out GeometryTechnique .osg support.

2007-09-11 12:28 +0000 [r7386]  robert:

	* Changed the isTextureIntegerSupported method so that it no longer
	  has the EXT entry in it for forward compatability reasons.

2007-09-11 12:04 +0000 [r7385]  robert:

	* From Art Trevs, "Features of the patch are: - Implementation of
	  integer textures as in EXT_texture_integer - setBorderColor(Vec4)
	  changed to setBorderColor(Vec4d) to pass double values as border
	  color. (Probably we have to provide an overloading function to
	  still support Vec4f ?) - new method
	  Texture::getInternalFormatType() added. Gives information if the
	  internal format normalized, float, signed integer or unsigned
	  integer. Can help people to write better code ;-) " Futher
	  changes to this submission by Robert Osfield, changed the dirty
	  mipmap flag into a buffer_value<> vector to ensure safe handling
	  of multiple contexts.

2007-09-11 10:16 +0000 [r7384]  robert:

	* From Rafa Giatan, "Changed int to GLsizei in the input parameter
	  of the method osg::Texture2DArray::applyTexImage2DArray_subload
	  inside Texture2DArray (lines 214 and 257), Otherwise it gives a
	  compile error on MacOSX."

2007-09-10 15:19 +0000 [r7379]  robert:

	* Intoduced a new setGLExtensions template method to do a copy of
	  void* pointer to local function pointer to avoid compiler
	  warnings related to case void*. Moved various OSG classes across
	  to using setGLExtensions instead of getGLExtensions, and changed
	  them to use typedef declarations in the headers rather than casts
	  in the .cpp. Updated wrappers

2007-09-08 07:21 +0000 [r7378]  robert:

	* Flesh out a bit more of the view IO support

	* Moved defined from Texture2DArray into Texture

2007-09-07 11:21 +0000 [r7371]  robert:

	* From Art Tevs, "A new texture class Texture2DArray derived from
	  Texture extends the osg to support the new EXT_texture_array
	  extensions. Texture arrays provides a feature for people
	  interesting in GPGPU programming. Faetures and changes: - Full
	  support for layered 2D textures. - New uniform types were added
	  (sampler2DArray) - FrameBufferObject implementation were changed
	  to support attaching of 2D array textures to the framebuffer -
	  StateSet was slightly changed to support texture arrays. NOTE:
	  array textures can not be used in fixed function pipeline. Thus
	  using the layered texture as a statemode for a Drawable produce
	  invalid enumerant OpenGL errors. - Image class was extended to
	  support handling of array textures Tests: I have used this class
	  as a new feature of my application. It works for me without
	  problems (Note: Texture arrays were introduced only for shading
	  languages and not for fixed function pipelines!!!). RTT with
	  Texture2DArray works, as I have tested them as texture targets
	  for a camera with 6 layers/faces (i.e. replacement for cube
	  maps). I am using the array textures in shader programming. Array
	  textures can be attached to the FBO and used as input and as
	  output."

2007-09-07 10:50 +0000 [r7370]  robert:

	* From Daniel Sjolie, "I patched the zip plugin to make use of my

	  the standard location..."

2007-09-07 10:15 +0000 [r7369]  robert:

	* From Guillaume Millet, "Please find in attachment a small
	  improvement to the pfb plugin CmakeLists.txt and to the
	  FindPerformer.cmake module. Under Windows libs are: libpf.lib (we
	  need to add the lib prefix) and libpfdu-util.lib (libpfdu and
	  libpfutil are compiled into one lib) We need to add PFROOT to the
	  search path for libs and includes (default environment variable
	  for Performer path) And at last we need to put PFROOT/include and
	  PFROOT/include/Performer as include dir for compiling."

2007-09-07 09:53 +0000 [r7368]  robert:

	* From Maria Ten, fix lat/long usage.

2007-09-07 09:49 +0000 [r7367]  robert:

	* From Mattias Linde, "Have made the updates now. Added a std::map
	  for easy lookup if a visual node is targeted by a rigid body
	  which is the reason why the .h-file was changed too. So now
	  there'll be Group as often as possible, otherwise
	  PostitionAttitudeTransform."

2007-09-03 13:52 +0000 [r7348]  robert:

	* From Jan Peciva, Added write support into Inventor plugin. Note
	  from Robert Osfield. A couple of lines of code in
	  ConvertToInventor.cpp would not compile under g++ 4.1.2, so
	  rather than hold back the dev release till this is resolved I've
	  optional compiled out the problem section. The #define
	  DISABLE_PROBLEM_COMPILE_SECTIONS is used to compile out the

	  You can easily check with "osgViewer --image klink1_l.tif". The
	  bug is in ReaderWriterTIFF.cpp function simage_tiff_load, where
	  numComponents_ret is incorrectly set to 1 instead of 3 for color
	  mapped data."

2007-09-03 10:04 +0000 [r7344]  robert:

	* From Almalric Alexandre, "I've noticed that all osgViewerMFC
	  example from osg 2.x.x are flickering when resizing 3D view, to
	  avoid this only add OnEraseBkgnd callback in CMFC_OSG_MDIView
	  class and do nothing in it. Just like the WxWidget example.
	  Attached the modified version of MFC_OSG_MDIView.cpp and
	  MFC_OSG_MDIView.h." Note from Robert Osfield, submission came
	  with wrong header file, so have had to guess at what it should
	  be, fingers crossed it worn't break windows build... :-)

2007-09-03 09:56 +0000 [r7342-7343]  robert:

	* From Laurens Voerman, "I hit a bug when making a copy of a

	  a wx build non UNICODE based. Tested on Linux with wxGTK 2.8.4"
	  osgviewerFOX: "Added removeChore() call in the FOX_OSG_MDIView
	  destructor to get rid of a Trace/BPT trap error on exit on Linux.
	  BTW this is suggested also in the FOX documentation."

2007-08-23 16:56 +0000 [r7282]  robert:

	* Made plugin build names lowercase

2007-08-23 16:33 +0000 [r7281]  robert:

2007-08-23 15:36 +0000 [r7279]  robert:

	* Updated for 2.1.7 dev release

2007-08-23 14:35 +0000 [r7278]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, fix for crash on exit

2007-08-23 14:31 +0000 [r7277]  robert:

	* From Galen Faidley," Please find attached the modifications to
	  get the new checkerboard stereo format to work. It's a good thing
	  I tested these on a TV before submitting them since I did indeed
	  have a bug. One thing I did not test was to see how this would
	  work in windowed mode. Does the interlaced stereo code have
	  support for 'absolute' positions? For example a given pixel on
	  the screen is always shown in a given eye no matter where the
	  graphics context is placed? "

2007-08-23 14:10 +0000 [r7276]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay,"As discussed yesterday on the osg-users
	  list, I have altered src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp to implement the
	  official Windows DLL search order as described on the page
	  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586.aspx . As
	  mentioned, the search order is now: 1. The directory from which
	  the application loaded. 2. The system directory.
	  (C:\Windows\System32 by default, gotten using the
	  GetSystemDirectory function) 3. The 16-bit system directory.
	  (C:\Windows\System by default, gotten by adding "\System" to the
	  path gotten in the next step...) 4. The Windows directory.
	  (C:\Windows by default, gotten using the GetWindowsDirectory
	  function) 5. The current directory. (".") 6. The directories that
	  are listed in the PATH environment variable. (as before) The
	  first four directories are obtained using Win32 API calls, so
	  they should work correctly even on non-standard Windows installs.
	  The changes are well commented and should be clear, even to
	  someone not familiar with the Win32 API. I have tested in a few
	  scenarios and it works as expected. Serge Lages has also tested
	  the changes and confirmed they worked as described. I have not
	  had any other reports though (positive or negative). I also fixed
	  the issue with a trailing semicolon on the PATH adding an empty
	  string to the end of the search paths, as this was an
	  inconsistent side effect rather than a desirable effect. This
	  change will take effect on other platforms as well, but since it
	  tests for an empty string in the last item added to the search
	  paths, it should have no adverse effect. "

2007-08-23 11:06 +0000 [r7275]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-08-23 11:00 +0000 [r7274]  robert:

	* Addd control for serializing draw dispatch.

2007-08-22 19:31 +0000 [r7273]  robert:

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "After a bit more testing, it was still
	  not 100% robust, so this fix will bring the change in line with
	  what is done on other OSes (Linux) and works in all tested cases.
	  For reference, this was tested with: osgviewer <file>.wrl (file
	  in current directory) osgviewer <dir>\<file>.wrl (file in child
	  directory, relative) osgviewer .\<dir>\<file>.wrl (file in child
	  directory, specify current) osgviewer <drive>:\<dir>\<file>.wrl
	  (absolute path) "

	* Changed the tolower of the file extension into the plugin name
	  construction code. Added support for CompositeLayer.

2007-08-16 15:29 +0000 [r7242]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-08-16 14:13 +0000 [r7241]  robert:

	* From Maria Ten, "I divide the init method of the
	  geometrytechnique in submethods to made more easy the inheritance
	  between the user and osg-class. This is a first step to add more
	  functions in osgTerrain. Maybe the subdivision of the method have
	  to be in the terraintechnique because is the base class of
	  GeometryTechnique. If Robert or anyone think that this is better
	  i change this class too."

2007-08-15 15:11 +0000 [r7240]  robert:

	* From Jan Ciger, "I am attaching a little hack from Jean-Sebastien
	  Guay which allows absolute paths to work on Windows."

2007-08-15 15:07 +0000 [r7239]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "the softshadowmap-implementation does not
	  compile on os x, to be more precise, the shader does not compile
	  on os x because of some type-conflicts ala "can not convert from
	  const int to const float" So I changed the offending lines to
	  force the type of the vars. It works now on OS X (albeit very
	  slowly, 3fps on a 7300), perhaps you find the changes useful.
	  Note: perhaps there is a better way in shaders to cast/convert
	  from int to float and viceversa."

2007-08-15 15:03 +0000 [r7238]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "The attached file updates the framestamp
	  and traversal number of the updatevisitor in osgViewer::Viewer.
	  The bug prevented DOF animations because osgSim::DOFTransform
	  checks the traversal number before doing any updates."

2007-08-14 17:13 +0000 [r7237]  robert:

	* Changed the plugin name to lower case to be consistent with the
	  way that osgDB::Registry searches for only lower case plugin
	  names.

2007-08-14 17:04 +0000 [r7236]  robert:

	* Added string to keyword map parser.

	* Updated version for 2.1.5 dev release

2007-08-13 10:31 +0000 [r7228]  robert:

	* From Luc Frauciel, "I've done 2 main modifications : 1) added
	  texture->setResizeNonPowerOfTwoHint(false); when loading an
	  image. It speeds up by 10 the loading of large images. 2) added a
	  --disk option : only a filelist is read, images are only loaded
	  when needed. It allows to handle very large set of very large
	  images that would not fit in memory. Nothing change when the
	  option is not set."

2007-08-13 10:27 +0000 [r7227]  robert:

	* From Jan Ciger, "I am attaching an improved version of the
	  OpenVRML plugin. It still uses OpenVRML 0.14.3 and is without the
	  Boost dependency. The changes: - - Fixed loading of textures and
	  normals when no corresponding indices are specified. It uses
	  vertex indices now, compliant with the VRML spec. - - Added
	  colour per vertex support. - - Added group node support. - -
	  Changed the code to use osg::ref_ptr instead of naked pointers to
	  avoid memory leaks. - - Fixed breakage for loading files
	  specified by relative path."

2007-08-13 10:20 +0000 [r7225-7226]  robert:

	* From J.P. Delport, fix of GDAL location search

	* From Brad Christiansen, "I added the ability to set the render
	  target implementaion on the osgSim::OverlayNode. The attached
	  changes were made against the 2.0 release."

2007-08-13 09:13 +0000 [r7224]  robert:

	* Added gdal/gdal.h to header search path, and gdal1.4.1 to the lib
	  search path.

2007-08-12 13:30 +0000 [r7223]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-08-12 13:18 +0000 [r7221-7222]  robert:

	* Added getStart()/getEnd()

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "adds
	  osgUtil::LineSegmentIntersector::setStart(osg::Vec3d) and
	  setEnd(osg::Vec3d)."

2007-08-12 13:10 +0000 [r7220]  robert:

	* Removed now redundent osgshadowtexture and osgdepthshadow
	  examples

2007-08-12 12:15 +0000 [r7217-7219]  robert:

	* Added support for SoftShadowMap into osgshadow example

	* Added fix for typo of name in submission

	* From Bruno Hebelin, "I have adapted to osgShadow the soft shadow
	  map technique described in "Efficient Soft-Edged Shadows Using
	  Pixel Shader Branching" by Yury Uralsky, Chapter 17 of GPU Gems 2
	  (Matt Pharr ed. Addison-Wesley). Here is my code in attachment:
	  basically, it works in the same way as osgShadow/ShadowMap (core
	  code is copied from it) but implements a specific GLSL shader for
	  the soft rendering of penumbra. I have tested it under Linux with
	  a NVidia graphic card, but there should be no dependency on
	  platform nor on the graphics driver (as far as they support GLSL
	  2). Screenshots attached show the current results (frame rate
	  bound to v-sync, but the shader takes actually not much time)."

2007-08-11 17:44 +0000 [r7216]  robert:

	* Added preprending of osgPlugins-version to plugin names

2007-08-11 14:49 +0000 [r7215]  robert:

	* Added DisplaySetting::s/getCompileContextHint() and use of this
	  hint in osgViewer::Viewer/CompositeViewer. Removed the
	  CustomViewer in osgterrain example as the above now removes the
	  need for it.

2007-08-11 12:43 +0000 [r7214]  robert:

	* Refactored the use of the MasterOperation so that it now gets
	  attached to the Viewer via the new Viewer::addUpdateOperation()
	  method, rather than need a custom Viewer::updateTraversal().

2007-08-11 10:28 +0000 [r7213]  robert:

	* Added support for an update OperationQueue to Viewer and
	  CompositeViewer to allow asyncrnous adding of operations to be
	  added to the view to be done during syncronous updateTraversal().
	  This feature can be used for doing things like merging subgraphs
	  that have been loaded in a background thread.

2007-08-10 17:44 +0000 [r7212]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-08-10 10:58 +0000 [r7210-7211]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Added View::setDatabasePager(..)

	  CompositeViewer to ensure that only on Scene exists per scene
	  graph.

2007-08-09 08:19 +0000 [r7208]  robert:

	* Compile fix

2007-08-09 08:15 +0000 [r7207]  robert:

2007-08-08 08:10 +0000 [r7205]  robert:

	* Added new statc prototype() and create() methods to CullVisitor
	  and DatabasePager to allow overriding of the default
	  implementations

2007-08-08 05:59 +0000 [r7204]  robert:

	* Removed unneeeded includes

2007-08-07 22:56 +0000 [r7203]  robert:

	* Updated CMakeLists.txt to reflect renaming of TerrainNode.

2007-08-07 19:53 +0000 [r7201]  robert:

	* Renamed osgTerrain::TerrainNode to osgTerrain::Terrain and
	  introduced basic .osg read support for osgTerrain::Terrain.

2007-08-07 15:51 +0000 [r7200]  robert:

	* Removed TerrainNode.cpp from CMakeLists.txt

	* Added preliminary shell of osgTerrain plugin

2007-08-07 14:49 +0000 [r7198]  robert:

	* From Luc Fruciel, "Gdal plugins reads lots of information that is
	  not taken into account in ReadHeigthField for example. Attached a
	  modification that read the HeigthField position and X,Yintervals.
	  I also removed the limitation to 1024*1024 to 4096*4096, because
	  when you are preprocessing your data with OSG, it can be useful
	  to read large images/heigthfields. Is there a reason (other than
	  hardware limitations for textures) for this limit ?"

2007-08-07 10:37 +0000 [r7197]  robert:

	* Re-introduceed GDAL plugin

2007-08-07 10:33 +0000 [r7195-7196]  robert:

	* Re-introduced GDAL plugin.

	* Added preliminary code to allow build specification of glu
	  tesscallback with ... parameter

2007-08-07 08:18 +0000 [r7194]  robert:

	* From Andy Skinner, The attached file adds #include <stdlib.h> to
	  GraphicsContext.cpp, so that it compiles with the solaris
	  compiler we use.

	  vertical split stereo are used.

2007-08-05 14:59 +0000 [r7187]  robert:

	* From Tim More, "This patch causes GraphicsWindowX11 to not send
	  key release events when a key press / release is caused by
	  auto-repeat. This is consistent with Windows and Mac behavior, as
	  well as other toolkits such as SDL."

2007-08-05 14:51 +0000 [r7186]  robert:

	* From Andy Skinner, fixes for avoiding warnings about mixing c and
	  c++ versions of c libs.

	* Disable the selection of CullPerCameraDrawPerContext until I am
	  able to fix this threading model

2007-08-04 10:30 +0000 [r7184]  robert:

	* From John Shue, "Recent changes to sockstream.cpp and
	  sockinet.cpp to better deal with various operating system
	  differences between socklen_t and int have broken the FreeBSD
	  build. Change was to add __FreeBSD__ to the list of defines that
	  are checked."

	  anything else set it."

2007-07-25 10:12 +0000 [r7162]  robert:

	* From Parag Chaudhur, "In daeRMaterials.cpp in the COLLADA plugin,
	  in the processTexture function, Lines 519-522 of the source file:
	  The "delete [] path" appears before the "osg::notify", causing
	  the data pointed to by "filename" to be deleted before access
	  causing an access violation. ... I have put a comment on line 521
	  where I have moved the "delete []path" below. "

	  with the example osgviewerMFC where the MFC rendering thread
	  would not exit before the application and the thread would be
	  left running in the background and the user would have to use
	  TaskManager to kill the process. Changes: MFC_OSG.cpp: Removed

	  plugin-readerwriters ("REGISTER_OSGPLUGIN") according to your
	  osgstaticviewer-example (see attachment, based on today's svn)."

2007-07-06 13:33 +0000 [r7075]  robert:

	  shown in graphics windows when traits specify that none should be
	  used (a recent change forced a left-pointer cursor as the
	  default). "

2007-07-05 10:51 +0000 [r7066]  robert:

	* Commented out "fix" that explictly sets the key modifier state as
	  this change actually broke the key modifier state management.

2007-07-03 17:32 +0000 [r7065]  robert:

	* From Thibault Genessay, "You'll find attached a fix for the
	  comments of the osgwindows example. It fixes a typo in the
	  comments which is quite disturbing for newbies trying to learn
	  using the source (twice 'left' instead of 'left' and 'right').
	  I've also added a little offset to the windows' positions so that
	  their decoration falls inside the desktop and we can manipulate
	  them - it looks a bit less "made out of wood"."

2007-07-03 13:26 +0000 [r7064]  robert:

	  ReaderWriter::Options object into readFontFile

2007-06-30 16:19 +0000 [r7058]  robert:

	* From Mike Connell, "This is a tiny fix for win32. The current
	  code takes the mouse cursor position and adds it to the window
	  (left,top) position, and sends the mouse cursor there. But this
	  doesn't take into account the window decoration. The new code
	  converts the given (x,y) coordinates from the client area
	  coordinate system to the screen instead using ClientToScreen. I
	  think this is the natural windows way to do it. Tested on XP with
	  osgviewer " Note from Robet Osfield, made a few changes to layout
	  to make it more consistent with the rest of the OSG and used #if
	  0 instead if (0) blocks.

2007-06-30 15:40 +0000 [r7057]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a small fix for the
	  3ds-plugin, so 3ds-files exported from cinema 4d are imported
	  correctly. It's not cinema's fault, because the 3ds-files show up
	  correctly in 3dStudio Max."

	* Updated wrappers

	* Added s/getUsage() method

	  camera.

	* Added debug path that creates the viewer on the heap.

2007-06-30 14:21 +0000 [r7052]  robert:

	* From David Callu, " Found in the join file the fix for the bug
	  found by Rafa. Problem : osgIntrospection::Value grp(new
	  osg::Group); osgIntrospection::ValueList vlcall;
	  vlcall.push_back(osgIntrospection::Value("toto")); const
	  osgIntrospection::MethodInfo *m =
	  grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod("setName", vlcall, true); if (m)
	  { m->invoke(grp, vlcall); // ** SEGFAULT here } Algorithm
	  explanation : The "invoke" method try to convert "grp", which
	  reflect an "osg::Group*", in a "osgIntrospection::Value", which
	  reflect a "osg::Node*". This because the "setName(const char *)"
	  method found by "grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod" is an
	  "osg::Object" type method. When osgIntrospection do this
	  conversion it try : - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter" to
	  convert from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*" - to found a chain of
	  "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert from "osg::Group*" to
	  "one or many type" to "osg::Node*" - to converte an Enum to int
	  or unsigned int - to convert the value in its "value string
	  representation", then converte this string in the destination
	  value Else it throw a "TypeConversionException". Bug : 1) When
	  osgIntrospection try to found a chain of
	  "osgIntrospection::Converter" It could do any downcast or (Type
	  to SuperType) or upcast (SuperType to Type). This mean the the
	  chain could be : osg::Group to osg::Transform to osg::Camera to
	  osg::CullSettings to osg::CullStack to
	  osg::CollectOccludersVisitor to osg::NodeVisitor to
	  osg::Referenced to osg::Object During the convertion with this
	  chain, A METTRE failed and the pointer in "grp" is set NULL. But
	  the "grp" is always a valid "osgIntrospection::Value" and so,
	  osgIntrospection accept the conversion. Then it try to use this
	  pointer to call the "setName" function. And Bing SEGFAULT. 2) In
	  "bool Reflection::accum_conv_path( ... )" the convection path
	  isn't accumulate in the recursive loop. this cause multi request
	  of a conversion path, and a slowdown in the conversion algorithm.
	  3) Use of the last conversion way in a conversion from pointer to
	  pointer this mean you can do this : "osg::Node*" to " value
	  string representation" to "osg::Material*" What a bad thing !!!
	  Solution : 1) Introduce the concept of dynamic_cast and
	  static_cast. now, to do a conversion, osgIntrospection does this
	  : - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert from
	  "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*" - to found a chain of
	  "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert from "osg::Group*" to
	  "one or many type" to "osg::Node*" only with static_cast,
	  downcast (Type to SuperType) - to found, if the source and the
	  destination are two pointer, a chain of
	  "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert from "osg::Group*" to
	  "one or many type" to "osg::Node*" only with dynamic_cast, upcast
	  (SuperType to Type) - to convert an Enum to int or to unsigned
	  int - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
	  then convert this string in the destination value Else it throw a
	  "TypeConversionException". Add the "enum CastType" to distinguish
	  the static_cast or dynamic_cast converter. Add file
	  OpenSceneGraph/include/osgIntrospection/CastType 2) add a line to
	  accumulate converter in converter Path. 3) add a line to check if
	  source and destination are pointer. "

2007-06-30 09:27 +0000 [r7051]  robert:

	  COLLADA library on Linux and shouldn't be linked separately -
	  those libraries do not exist in the default Linux build and the
	  compilation will fail. Second issue - the current version of the
	  COLLADA plugin (both current HEAD in Subversion and the one in
	  stable 2.0) do not work right with the stable COLLADA DOM 1.4.1.

	* Updated wrappers

2007-06-10 19:53 +0000 [r6931]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber and Robert Osfield, Stephan: "attached you'll
	  find some modifications to the GraphicsWindow-class and their
	  platform-dependant implementations. The problem:
	  setWindowRectangle and setWindowDecoration do not update the
	  traits-object, so, if you call setWindowRectangle on a
	  not-realized-window it will open with another size when realized
	  later. getWindowRectangle reports possible wrong sizes if
	  setWindowRectangle called before. My solution: split the
	  implementation in two parts: GraphicsWindow::setWindowRectangle
	  will update its traits-object and call afterwards the virtual
	  method setWindowRectangleImplementation (which is implemented by
	  the derived platformspecific classess). For setWindowDecoration I
	  am useing a similar mechanism. I hope you'll find the submission
	  useful, the Win32 and X11 changes are not tested but should
	  work." Changes to this made by Robert are call of resized in
	  setWindowRectangle instead of setting of Traits, and use of a
	  bool return type.

	  GL_HALF_FLOAT_NV pixel formats."

2007-06-10 19:18 +0000 [r6929]  robert:

	  "unsupported" using osg::notify(osg::WARN) and are not loaded:
	  A8R3G3B2, G16R16, G16R16F, G32R32F and CxV8U8. Also added
	  checking of not supported DDPF_BUMPDUDV (V8U8, V16U16, Q8W8U8L8,

	  them in my own code. "

2007-06-08 10:58 +0000 [r6906]  robert:

	* From Jason Daly, "We have a few OpenFlight files that used to
	  display properly with the old loader, but appear very, very wrong
	  with the new one. I traced the problem to the handling of the
	  palette override flags in the external reference records. The
	  current behavior for handling the palette override flags for
	  external references has different offsets for different
	  OpenFlight version (2 bytes for 14.2-15.1 and 4 bytes for 15.2
	  and later). However, I believe this behavior is incorrect. I know
	  that the original 14.2 OpenFlight spec (dated April 1995)
	  specifies 2 bytes between the filename and the override flags,
	  and the 15.4 and later specs specify 4 bytes. However, I also
	  found a 14.2.4 OpenFlight spec (dated January 1996) that changes
	  the specification to 4 bytes. Also, the databases in question
	  were created using an old IRIX version of MultiGen II, which
	  wrote OpenFlight 14.2 files natively. These files also have 4
	  bytes between the filename and flags. Furthermore, these
	  databases have always worked properly under earlier versions of
	  OSG, under Performer, and in every MultiGen product we've used.
	  This leads me to believe that the original 14.2 spec was
	  incorrect (the 14.2.4 spec corrected this error), and there
	  should be 4 bytes between the filename and flags for all
	  OpenFlight files version 14.2 and later. The attached fix
	  modifies the OpenFlight loader to behave in this way."

	  doesn't explicitly specify an internal format, the loader will
	  force it to use GL_RGB, which keeps translucent textures (eg.
	  GL_RGBA textures) from showing up properly. This patch changes
	  the default behavior to simply use the image's format instead of
	  forcing a particular format."

2007-06-08 10:16 +0000 [r6901]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, "So, something strange happened to the repo and
	  some of this project's files got messed up, most notiably the Nib
	  and also the Localized strings file. I didn't notice the latter
	  until now so Martin is missing this file. Anyway, the attached
	  tar contains all new versions of all the necessary files. There
	  are cleanups and fixes to a lot of things. Martin did a good job
	  porting the thing to osg::Viewer so most of the code changes I
	  made address other areas. Two things I noticed in the new port
	  you might want to consider as feedback. First, there might be a
	  bug with osgViewer when the view size goes to 0. If you play with
	  the splitviews in this program and shrink the view until it is
	  closed, and then re-expand it, the model doesn't come back, not
	  even after a home() call. SimpleViewer didn't have this problem.
	  Second, a more minor thing, this program has a
	  take-screenshot--and-copy-to-clipboard feature via Cmd-C (or Menu
	  item). I achieve this by using osg::Camera to render to an FBO
	  and then copy the contents to Cocoa. To insert the camera, I
	  manipulate the scenegraph so I can get the camera node in and
	  out. I end up calling setSceneData at the end of eveything to
	  restore everything to the original state before I started mucking
	  with the scenegraph. This unfortunately, triggers a home() reset.
	  So in this particular case, it make Copy look like it's changing
	  the scene. The old SimpleViewer had the same problem, but I was
	  able to work around it by directly invoking the underlying
	  SceneView's setSceneData so the home() mechanism was bypassed.
	  The viewer design seems to protect this data more carefully so
	  the bypass trick won't work. My feedback is that maybe a flag or
	  extra parameter can be introduced so a reset is not triggered if
	  not desired. I have checked in a ton of Xcode fixes for the
	  entire build process in general so once this piece gets checked
	  in, hopefully everything will build cleanly."

2007-06-08 10:11 +0000 [r6900]  robert:

	* From Mike Wittman, "This change to genwrapper and
	  osgIntrospection gives access to the declaring file for a given
	  type via the new member function
	  osgIntrospection::Type::getDeclaringFile. This information is
	  useful in order to know what header to include when
	  auto-generating wrappers for a given type. During the C# wrapper
	  generator development I've been keeping the declaring file
	  configuration state up-to-date manually with changes to OSG, and
	  it's proven to require substantial effort. So it would be
	  extremely valuable to get this change in before 2.0 to reduce
	  maintenance during the lifetime of the release. It'll also be
	  equally useful to others looking to create wrapper generators
	  using osgIntrospection. This is a fairly simple change and was
	  tested with a fresh rebuild of the entire suite of osgWrapper
	  libraries, so it should be relatively low risk (fingers
	  crossed)."

2007-06-08 09:45 +0000 [r6899]  robert:

2007-06-08 05:03 +0000 [r6897]  ewing:

	* Changed the version to 2.0.0 in the Info.plist in anticipation of
	  the official release. I don't know what the OpenThreads version
	  number will be, so that has been left alone.

2007-06-08 04:57 +0000 [r6896]  ewing:

	* Lots of various fixes to Xcode project. - Adding missing header
	  files and making sure they are marked public. - Support to copy
	  headers in Viewer/api into the proper location in framework -
	  Internalized OpenThreads build so cross-project dependency is not
	  needed. Can now delete copy of OpenThreads project. Frameworks
	  use native Xcode linking mechanism. Plugins/Examples still use
	  explicit -framework OpenThreads. Could potentially be problem is
	  old OpenThreads is on the system. This can be changed to use
	  native mechanism too, but requires some patience because it is
	  tedious to change. - Lots of fixes to osgViewerCocoa (something
	  got messed up pretty badly...files are missing from repo).
	  Another submission will need to readd these files back.

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "on my MacOS X/cmake setup the zlib plugin
	  isn't built by default. This may be because zlib.h is installed

	  possible to use the same source for both QT3 and QT4

2007-06-02 15:31 +0000 [r6815]  robert:

	* Added osgViewer::GraphicsWindowEmbedded and ported GLUT, SDL and
	  WX examples across from SimpleViewer to Viewer.

2007-06-02 12:03 +0000 [r6814]  robert:

	* Ported GLUT example to using osgViewer::Viewer rather than
	  SimpleViewer by using a local GraphicsWindowEmbedded class to

2007-06-01 22:41 +0000 [r6813]  robert:

	* Renamed all osgsimpleviewer* files to osgviewer*

2007-06-01 22:28 +0000 [r6811]  robert:

	* updated wrapper

2007-06-01 21:38 +0000 [r6810]  robert:

	* From J.P Delport, "attached find an updated osgunittests.cpp that
	  allows for the testing of the matrix.getRotate() function when a
	  matrix contains a scale as well as a rotation. The scale can
	  optionally be switched off, see the top of testQuatFromMatrix().
	  As expected, all the current methods for mat to quat conversion
	  fail these new tests. When the scale is omitted, mk2 of getRotate
	  with sign instead of signOrZero passes, as well as mk1. "

2007-06-01 21:33 +0000 [r6809]  robert:

	* From Maria Ten, "The constructor method of the EllipsoidLocator
	  of osgTerrain assumes that the terrain is always the Earth
	  planet. I changed the constructor method to accept the Equator
	  radius and the Polar radius like parameters. By default, it
	  assumes the Earth radius for the EllipsoidLocator. I added a
	  setEllipsoidModel method, too. Now, we are developing some
	  libraries for a GIS applicacion, and our libraries can visualize
	  terrains of planets like Mars. I think that is a interesting
	  change."

2007-06-01 21:28 +0000 [r6808]  robert:

	* From Michael Hartman, "CMakeLists.txt: Changed this back to
	  setup_example since WIN32 flag is now supported. MFC_OSG.h: Added
	  flag to indicate when the rendering thread has exited.
	  MFC_OSG.cpp: Code modifications to support rendering flag thread
	  exit. MFC_OSG_MDIView.cpp: Change to OnDestroy function to wait
	  until we get render thread exit flag is true before we close the
	  window. Main Exit Process: User presses escape button Viewer
	  captures escape button and stops threading etc. Viewer sets Done
	  when shutdown is complete MFC Render Thread monitors viewer->done
	  for true MFC Render Thread exits while loop and sets MFC Done
	  flag MFC View Window monitors MFC Done flag and then
	  closes/destroys the window "

2007-06-01 19:53 +0000 [r6807]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-06-01 19:45 +0000 [r6804-6806]  robert:

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I did few tests to see whether adding
	  PreDraw callback would help us with SPI problems when using
	  Viewer. Results were positive so I decided to give it a try and
	  ask you to verify and maybe merge with existing codebase. I added
	  _preDrawCallback member and neccessary access methods plus
	  modified osgUtil RenderStage.cpp to invoke it before all
	  drawInner calls are made. I tried to maintain symmetry with
	  postDrawCallback but you know better where is a proper place for
	  this call ;-) "

	* Updates to OverlayData

	* From Mathias Froelich, "have done an interface to change the
	  mouse cursor in the X11 graphics window. The win32 implementation
	  is still in its original shape since I have no win32
	  implementation available. I have chosen the enum approach for the
	  first cut. That is benefitial since the user does not need to
	  track creation of mouse cursors for different windows and
	  displays in presence of multiple viewer windows. The default set
	  of available mouse shapes is the same set that was available with
	  glut. That set served many OpenGL applications well, so the hope
	  is that this is enough. Even though, that implementation is still
	  extensible: I have digged out the way SDL defines new mouse
	  cursors and added a still documented out function prototype in
	  the GraphicsWindow that can be used to extend the current
	  implemtation for arbitrary mouse shapes. That is not implemented
	  yet. I hope that somebody with a win32 test system can catch up
	  that implementation on win32."

2007-06-01 19:21 +0000 [r6802-6803]  robert:

	* Removed setViewUpOnScreen settings

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find the modified
	  ImageStream and a small fix for QuicktimeImageStream to disable
	  debug-logging :)"

2007-06-01 19:10 +0000 [r6801]  robert:

	* From Mike Wittman, "Just found another issue building the C#
	  wrappers: the osgTerrain ValidDataOperator file uses osg::Vec2,
	  osg::Vec3, and osg::Vec4, but does not include their headers. The
	  file with the relevant includes is attached. "

2007-06-01 19:01 +0000 [r6799-6800]  robert:

	* Removed the debug message for the ortho path.

	* Changed name of AnimationPathHandler to RecordCameraPathHandler

	* From Jeremy Moles, new event handler to record the camera path. A
	  few small tweaks by Robert Osfield to make it more consistent
	  with the old osgProducer::Viewer behavior.

2007-05-30 17:56 +0000 [r6793]  robert:

2007-05-29 13:28 +0000 [r6787]  robert:

	* Added support for specifying which screen number to place the
	  window

2007-05-29 10:31 +0000 [r6786]  robert:

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "The issue itself occurs when a model is
	  tessellated that has greater than unsigned short number of
	  vertexes. An object called vertexPtrToIndexMap contains vertexes
	  and their indexes. This std::map object can obviously hold a
	  quantity that is greater than unsigned short, however
	  osg::DrawElementsUShort objects were being created to reference
	  these vertexes and their indexes. osg::DrawElementsUShort can
	  only hold indexes that are 16-bit quantities. ...
	  proposed_patch_2\tessellator.cpp. This solution examines the size
	  of vertexPtrToIndexMap and selects 1 of 3 possible
	  osg::DrawElements objects: DrawElementsUByte, DrawElementsUShort,
	  or DrawElementsUInt. The main drawback of this particular
	  solution is the code duplication. However, the repair is
	  straightforward."

2007-05-29 10:01 +0000 [r6784]  robert:

	* From Olaf Flebbe, "recently I discovered that the freetype plugin
	  does not work, because CMake doesn't recognize it properly on
	  windows. 1) the header detection on a directory "freetype" fails,
	  it seems to need a filename: "ft2build.h" actually works. 2) the
	  3rdparty I am supplying for FlightGear contains freetype-2.3.4. I
	  added the correct library naming for this particular release. I
	  double-checked my directory layout with the 3rdparty supplied by
	  other OSG contributors."

2007-05-29 09:57 +0000 [r6783]  robert:

	* From Olar Flebbe, "Visual Studio 2005 triggered a small glitch in

	* Updated version number, wrappers and readme for release

2007-05-28 10:14 +0000 [r6771]  robert:

	* From Frauciel Luc, "Added support for other pointers than mouses
	  by using a nearpoint and farpoint instead of mousex,mousey +
	  Camera (see Dragger and Dragger.cpp). The major modification
	  concern the LineProjector class in Projector.cpp. The
	  intersection was previously done in window space, I've modified
	  it to compute it in object space."

2007-05-28 09:30 +0000 [r6770]  robert:

	* Removed old ProgrammingGuide as this is now replaced by the
	  proper Quick Start Guide.

2007-05-27 19:35 +0000 [r6769]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-05-27 18:18 +0000 [r6768]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-05-27 17:29 +0000 [r6767]  robert:

	* Added camera event callback support into osgViewer

2007-05-27 15:24 +0000 [r6766]  robert:

	* Updated calling of master camera's update callback

	* Added testing to see if camera allows events before automatically
	  attaching a trackball manipulator

	* Added option for using the different overlay techniques.

2007-05-26 16:02 +0000 [r6763]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-05-26 15:55 +0000 [r6762]  robert:

	* Added a basic configure script to allow the setting of Release
	  build by default.

2007-05-26 15:49 +0000 [r6760-6761]  robert:

	* Fixes to help C# binding dev.

	* From Blake Williams, "I discovered why the \u2013CompositeViewer
	  option for the osghud example does not work. The run() function
	  adds a camera manipulator to each view that does not have one
	  assigned, which causes the view with the HUD camera to point
	  somewhere other than where it should. I just added a check before
	  a new default camera manipulator is added to ensure that the view
	  allows event focus before a camera manipulator is added."

2007-05-26 15:42 +0000 [r6759]  robert:

	* From Charles Cole, "Attached are mods to the OpenFlight plug-in
	  to help further implement the specification. With these mods,
	  blink sequences are now created for flashing light point nodes,
	  either palletized (v.15.8 and later) or non-palletized (15.7 and
	  earlier). Thanks to Brede for his implementation of the
	  palletized light point nodes. There is still work to do on adding
	  the capability to properly handle light point system nodes, but
	  this does add some capability that did not previously exist. So,
	  I wanted to at least submit this and I will hopefully provide the
	  additional capability in the near future. I've tested the code
	  modifications with Visual Studio 2005. I don't have the means to
	  test any other operating system, but I would suspect that there
	  shouldn't be any issue (famous last words). I used the test files
	  that I uploaded to the users forum to test the changes. In
	  addition to the added capability, I changed the light point node
	  radius to the "actualPixelSize" value in the file. Previously,
	  the radius was set to half the actual pixel size (see
	  LightPointRecords.cpp). Not sure why this was the case. But, it
	  was brought to my attention by a co-worker who created the
	  OpenFlight files and was testing them with different viewers. If
	  there's some history for setting the radius to half the size,
	  then this change can be omitted."

2007-05-26 15:17 +0000 [r6758]  robert:

	* Added exclude of svn directories.

2007-05-25 19:35 +0000 [r6757]  robert:

	* From Charles Cole, "he attached code implements the
	  LightPointSystem class to allow for the OpenFlight plug-in to
	  read and handle light point system nodes. The behavior is very
	  similar to the old plug-in in that a MultiSwitch node is created
	  to handle the "enabled" flag bit set in the node record. The code
	  also reverts the changes for the actualPixelSize as mentioned
	  above. And lastly, the code requires the previously submitted
	  changes for the plug-in. As for the other changes, I've tested
	  the code with Visual Studio 2005 and the files that I posted in
	  the users forum. With all of the submitted changes, the
	  OpenFlight plug-in should now be capable of loading files with
	  light point system nodes and the use of palletized light points
	  and non-palletized light points. "

2007-05-25 19:32 +0000 [r6756]  robert:

	* Comment out the setting of single threading.

2007-05-25 16:00 +0000 [r6754-6755]  robert:

	* Added s/getOverlayBaseHeight methods

	* Changed debug message to INFO

2007-05-24 16:11 +0000 [r6747]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, "The writeImage method in
	  ReaderWriterPNM.cpp had an error checking the accepted file
	  extensions, so that once the plugin was loaded in the Registry it
	  would grab any image file write request, regardless of the file
	  extension. This was a particular problem if it was statically
	  loaded."

2007-05-24 14:20 +0000 [r6746]  robert:

	* Improved the polytope cutting and project calculation

2007-05-24 10:15 +0000 [r6745]  robert:

	* From Peter Hrenka, fixes regarding line-strips and -loops.

2007-05-24 09:49 +0000 [r6744]  robert:

	* From Olaf, "there are more dubious calls to istream::readsome
	  instead of istream::read. IMHO it does make no sense here and
	  potentially breaks this plugin."

2007-05-24 08:51 +0000 [r6743]  robert:

	* From Serge Lages, support for install api directories, with
	  tweaks from Robert Osfield

	* Added angular sorting of the points on the plane intersecting the
	  cut plane.

2007-05-23 12:35 +0000 [r6736]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-05-23 12:21 +0000 [r6735]  robert:

	* Added platform specific GraphicsWindow* headers to public headers
	  listings

2007-05-23 11:05 +0000 [r6734]  robert:

	* From Peter Hrenka, (note from Robert Osfield, renamed
	  GenericPrimitiveFunctor mention below to
	  TemplatePrimitiveFunctor). "Since we desperately needed a means
	  for picking Lines and Points I implemented (hopefully!) proper
	  geometrical tests for the PolytopeIntersector. First of all I
	  implemented a new "GenericPrimiteFunctor" which is basically an
	  extended copy TriangleFunctor which also handles Points, Lines
	  and Quads through suitable overloads of operator(). I would have
	  liked to call it "PrimitiveFunctor" but that name was already
	  used... I used a template method to remove redundancy in the
	  drawElements method overloads. If you know of platforms where
	  this will not work I can change it to the style used in
	  TriangleFunctor. In PolytopeIntersector.cpp I implemented a
	  "PolytopePrimitiveIntersector" which provides the needed
	  overloads for Points, Lines, Triangles and Quads to the
	  GenericPrimitiveFunctor. This is then used in the intersect
	  method of PolytopeIntersector. Implementation summary: - Points:
	  Check distance to all planes - Lines: Check distance of both ends
	  against each plane. If both are outside -> line is out If both
	  are in -> continue checking One is in, one is out -> compute
	  intersection point (candidate) Then check all candidates against
	  all other polytope planes. The remaining candidates are the
	  proper intersection points of the line with the polytope. -
	  Triangles: Perform Line-Checks for all edges of the triangle as
	  above. If there is an proper intersection -> done. In the case
	  where there are more than 2 polytope plane to check against we
	  have to check for the case where the triangle encloses the
	  polytope. In that case the intersection lines of the polytope
	  planes are computed and checked against the triangle. - Quads:
	  handled as two triangles. This is implementation is certainly not
	  the fastest. There are certainly ways and strategies to improve
	  it. I also enabled the code for PolytopeIntersector in
	  osgkeyboardmouse and added keybindings to switch the type of
	  intersector ('p') and the picking coordinate system ('c') on the
	  fly. Since the PolytopeIntersector does not have a canonical
	  ordering for its intersections (as opposed to the
	  LineSegementIntersector) I chaged the implementation to toggle
	  all hit geometries. I tested the functionality with
	  osgkeyboardmouse and several models and it seems to work for
	  polygonal models. Special nodes such as billboards do not work.
	  The next thing on my todo-list is to implement a an improved
	  Intersection-Structure for the PolytopeIntersector. We need to
	  know which primitives where hit (and where). "

2007-05-23 10:57 +0000 [r6733]  robert:

	* Added debug timing code

2007-05-22 15:17 +0000 [r6732]  robert:

	* Added _firstTimeToInitEyePoint = true to the setAutoRotateMode to
	  force the AutoTransform to recompute its position on next frame.

2007-05-22 14:00 +0000 [r6731]  robert:

	* From Roger James, "Here is a small fix for the ac3d plugin
	  geode.cpp. The fix is entirely localised to
	  ac3d::Geode::OutputTriangleStripDARR. It resolves an issue when
	  processing a DrawArrayLengths with multiple lengths where the
	  vertex indices were incorrect for all but the first chunk."

2007-05-22 13:48 +0000 [r6730]  robert:

	* Changed the way the the InputRange is adjusted on the event state
	  to fix bugs related to picking

2007-05-22 09:32 +0000 [r6729]  robert:

	* Added osg::Camera::ProjectionResizePolicy enum and associated
	  methods for controlling how the field of view is adjust on window
	  resizes.

2007-05-21 18:46 +0000 [r6728]  robert:

	* Added extra checks to make sure that graphics operations arn't
	  done on no longer valid graphics contexts

	* Updated version numbers for 1.9.5 release

2007-05-21 09:18 +0000 [r6713]  robert:

	* Updated ChangeLog

2007-05-21 08:01 +0000 [r6712]  robert:

	* From Olaf Flebbe, "FlightGear/OSG on Windows did not load the
	  Texture Fonts. 1) TXF Fonts are binary. 2) Do not rely on the
	  result of istream::readsome if buffer _is_ empty and no data have
	  been read before."

2007-05-21 07:54 +0000 [r6711]  robert:

	* Added static build support to export macros

2007-05-21 06:57 +0000 [r6710]  robert:

	* Added istream:imbue(std::locale::classic()) setting to prevent
	  non classic locals from being used when the .osg plugin reads and
	  writes.

2007-05-20 17:38 +0000 [r6709]  robert:

	* Introduced VERSION and SOVERSION'ing of libraries.

2007-05-20 13:42 +0000 [r6706]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find some modifications and
	  enhancements to the carbon's implementation of GraphicsWindow: -
	  usage of WindowData, you can specify an existing window to use
	  via osg::Traits - implementation of setScreenResolution and
	  setScreenRefreshRate - implementation of setWindowDecoration when
	  window is already created. There seems to be a bug regarding
	  multiple threads and closing windows, see my other mail on
	  osg-users. "

2007-05-20 12:29 +0000 [r6705]  robert:

	* Added support for version of the osgPlugins directory, which now
	  gets versioned according to the OpenSceneGraph/CMakeLists.txt and
	  the include/osg/Version settings. These changes mean that the
	  1.9.5 release will have a libs/osgPlugins-1.9.5 directory.

2007-05-20 11:45 +0000 [r6704]  robert:

	* Added support for SG_USE_FLOAT_MATRIX and OSG_USE_FLOAT_PLANE in
	  CMake build and include/osg/Matrix and include/osg/Plane.

2007-05-20 11:13 +0000 [r6703]  robert:

	* Fixed build error under float matrix build

2007-05-20 09:55 +0000 [r6702]  robert:

	* From Lugi Calori, added control of lib postfix.

2007-05-19 14:00 +0000 [r6701]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "I cleaned the code a little bit and improved
	  the handling of loops: I added a new protected virtual method to
	  ImageStream called applyLoopingMode() which is called from
	  setLoopingMode. The quicktime-plugin has an implementation of
	  applyLoopingMode which sets some flags for the quicktime, so that
	  quicktime handles the loop playback by itself. This has some
	  benefits: + no gaps when looping audio + simplified code Attached
	  you'll find the modified files, hope you'll find them useful."

2007-05-19 13:43 +0000 [r6700]  robert:

	* Various additions to better support view dependent overlay node,
	  and updated wrappers

2007-05-19 13:39 +0000 [r6698-6699]  robert:

	* From Rafa Giatan and Robert Osfield, added support for User
	  defined events, by adding UserData to Events.

	* Made the near far ratio lower to allow one to be near the terrain
	  before clipping comes in to effect

2007-05-19 12:27 +0000 [r6697]  robert:

	* From Michael Hartman, "I have made a small change to the
	  osgviewerMFC application that resolved most of my home computer
	  issues. It seams that my home computer needed to have the pixel
	  format set with PFD_DOUBLEBUFFER. Also, with the cmake ability
	  you are free to remove the MFC_OSG_MDI.vcproj file. "

2007-05-19 12:16 +0000 [r6696]  robert:

	* From Lugi Calori, fix for Win32 build of osgsimpleviewerWX

2007-05-19 07:08 +0000 [r6695]  robert:

	* In Drawable::releaseGLObjects() replaced glDeleteLists with
	  Drawable::deleteDisplayList(..) to prevent inappropriate OpenGL
	  deletion when current thread does have required grpahics contxt

2007-05-18 11:22 +0000 [r6694]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-05-18 10:33 +0000 [r6693]  robert:

	* Added support for tracking the CoordinateSystemNode path, and
	  passing this on to camera manipulators.

2007-05-18 09:49 +0000 [r6692]  robert:

	* Added range of CameranManipulators to allow us to navigate the
	  scene freely

2007-05-18 09:43 +0000 [r6691]  robert:

	* Added -f/--fixed option to allow use to freeze the animation of

	* Added saving and restoring of the near/far planes during Camera
	  setup

2007-05-17 11:55 +0000 [r6687]  robert:

	* From Serge Lages, "Here is a modified GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp
	  which handle double click events. I've modified the file
	  submitted yesterday by Andre and not the current SVN version."

2007-05-17 11:48 +0000 [r6686]  robert:

	* From David Callu, "I have added the uninstall command at the end
	  of the first file, and the configuration file template use by the
	  command is the second file. The command use the
	  cmake_install.cmake file which list all file installed by the
	  install target. this issue come from the CMake FAQ"

2007-05-17 11:04 +0000 [r6685]  robert:

	* From Michael Hartman, "I have gone in and created a CMakeList.txt
	  file for osgviewerMFC application. Below is the changes made to
	  the included files. The examples CMakeList.txt file was not
	  included but the code change needed for osgviewerMFC inclusion is
	  listed below. CMakeList.txt: This is a little different than
	  other example cmakelist.txt files in that I could not use the
	  setup_example macro. I had to go in and extract out the important
	  parts of the macro and inline them in the CMakeList.txt file so
	  that I could add the WIN32 declaration into the ADD_EXECUTABLE()
	  statement. In the future the setup_example macro might be
	  modified to support osgviewerMFC but this is special case so you
	  might not want to muddy the water for one example. MFC_OSG.h:
	  This file had some small changes: From: #include
	  <osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32> To: #include
	  <osgViewer/api/win32/GraphicsWindowWin32> Also added two new
	  function declarations Void PreFrameUpdate(void); Void
	  PostFrameUpdate(void); MFC_OSG.cpp: This file changed only in
	  that I am explicitly showing the viewer run loop and added the
	  two new functions in the MFC_OSG.h file. "

2007-05-17 10:59 +0000 [r6684]  robert:

	* From Andre Garneau, warnings fixes fo VC++

2007-05-17 10:33 +0000 [r6683]  robert:

	* From Andre Garneau,"Please find attached changes to have the
	  GraphicsWindowWin32 class selectively set the pixel format for
	  windows that are inherited, following some discussions on the
	  mailing list last week. This is implemented through a new traits
	  flag (setInheritedWindowPixelFormat) with a default state of
	  false (to avoid breaking existing applications). When set to
	  true, the pixel format of the inherited window will be set
	  according to the traits specifications. "

2007-05-16 19:19 +0000 [r6682]  robert:

	* Futher work on view dependent OverlayNode

2007-05-16 14:22 +0000 [r6681]  robert:

	* Refactored the internals of OverlayNode

2007-05-16 11:32 +0000 [r6680]  robert:

	* Added code for computing the frustum dimensions in local coords
	  to the overlay node

2007-05-15 19:45 +0000 [r6679]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "This is an other small update for the
	  ac3d loader: - It avoids attaching texture coordinates if there
	  is not texture attached. - It uses DrawArrayLengths instead of
	  multiple DrawElements."

2007-05-15 19:32 +0000 [r6678]  robert:

	* From Blasius Czink, "when creating windows with decorations
	  (titlebar) the mouse position should be adjusted."

2007-05-15 19:25 +0000 [r6677]  robert:

	* From Laurens Voerman, "Attached is a version of
	  src\osgViewer\GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp that allows to render in
	  software. (maybe also in hardware w/o wglChoosePixelFormatARB)"

2007-05-15 17:04 +0000 [r6675-6676]  robert:

	* Added code to better compute the view frustum that is appropriate
	  for a traversed subgraph.

	* Changed back to use find Qt3 and Qt4 separately to avoid QT error
	  reports

2007-05-15 14:55 +0000 [r6673-6674]  robert:

	* From John Kelso, Added support for new Sequence options. From
	  Robert Osfield, updated the above changes to the .ive loader so
	  that the new addition were tested against the IVE version number

	* Added -n/--no-overlay option

2007-05-15 11:31 +0000 [r6672]  robert:

	* From Mathieu Marache, "I tried the latest developper release
	  1.9.4 and found that I hadn't the osgsimpleviewerQt4 example in
	  my Visual studio solutions... After looking into it it seems that
	  you cannot have both Qt3 and Qt4 enabled. After modifying the
	  root CMakeLists.txt to use : FIND_PACKAGE(Qt) which should ask
	  you to choose betwwen Qt3 and Qt4 if you have both instead of :
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt3) FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4) I had the project generated.
	  But then due to the way CMake handles Qt4 I had to modify
	  osgsimpleviewerQt4's CMakeLists.txt to have the binary link with
	  QtOpengl4. "

2007-05-15 11:25 +0000 [r6670-6671]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I made a modification to the
	  setClientActiveTextureUnit and setActiveTextureUnit methods of
	  osg::State so they return false if the texture unit is outside
	  the range of allowable units for the driver. Currently, the
	  functions would return true even if the units are invalid. This
	  would cause the osg::State to become out of sync with the actual
	  driver state, which can cause some bugs in certain cases. The
	  change I made would verify that the unit passed to
	  setClientActiveTextureUnit is below GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS, and
	  the unit passed to setActiveTextureUnit is below
	  max(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS,GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS). I
	  modeled this behavior from the OpenGL docs for these commands

	* From Serge Lages, "Here is a ViewerEventHandler file with a
	  collection of helper handlers for osgViewer. Most of the code is
	  from the osgviewer application, I have took the fullscreen

	  basic and the community is welcome to enhance/improve this
	  example. There is one bug documented in the Readme.txt file that
	  I just have not had time to solve. Also, the code is built
	  outside of the OSG environment and uses environment variables to
	  get to the OSG distribution headers and examples. That should be

	  and _step our of the include file and made them local variables
	  in whatever method might need them. I got rid of the _recalculate
	  method as it was only getting used in one place. I also found a
	  cut/paste bug in setMode's START case." Note from Robert Osfield,
	  Also includes some guards against crashes that was occuring in
	  this new code when handling empty Sequences.

	* Added use of OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE for clamping texture sizes.

2007-05-09 10:01 +0000 [r6629]  robert:

	* From Mike Weiblen, with mods of using references by Robert
	  Osfield for efficiency. Submission notes from Mike: "By
	  repurpose, I'm creating a new plugin that uses much of the .osg
	  fileformat, but with some changes. Specifically, I'm creating a
	  ".osgfs" plugin, which represents the scenegraph hierarchy as a
	  filesystem of nested subdirectories and individual files for each
	  node, rather than nested braces with everything in a single
	  monolithic file. I intend to incorporate file alteration monitor
	  events to watch the filesystem for modifications and
	  automatically reload. The problem I'm running into is osgDB is
	  too tightly coupled to the .osg format.
	  osgDB::Output::writeObject() contains literal .osg
	  format-specific strings like "{" to represent the Object
	  hierarchy at too low a semantic level. I propose using virtual
	  methods; my plugin can then derive from osgDB::Output and
	  represent Object hiearchy differently. "

2007-05-09 09:43 +0000 [r6628]  robert:

	* From Alan Harris, "Registry and Archive ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  This is a simple change to permit databases other than those
	  named "*.osga" to be used. It is hardcoded in read() at present.
	  It is non-critical and does not affect existing program
	  functionality. Registry and Registry.cpp
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Added a new typedef: typedef
	  std::vector< std::string> ArchiveExtensionList; a list of
	  extensions: ArchiveExtensionList _archiveExtList; and an "add"
	  method: addArchiveExtension(const std::string ext) This is
	  initialised by adding "osga" in Registry() and used in
	  Registry::read() where the list is searched for the extension
	  used. Archive.cpp ~~~~~~~~~~~ This submission is a little more
	  tentative. openArchive() is modified to automatically add the
	  filename extension to the Registry extension list. "

2007-05-09 09:26 +0000 [r6627]  robert:

	  missing. I'm not sure if it was intentionally removed from the
	  project, so I left the everything in place, but removed the
	  target from the build aggregate targets so it doesn't get in the
	  way of the build system. Added back osgTerrain to the project

	* Further work on the new VBO support

2007-04-27 10:29 +0000 [r6562]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, " Here are more changes for the CMake scripts: -
	  I removed CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in FindOpenThreads as a follow up
	  to the discussion thread. - I introduced an experimental
	  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to replace it. - I added CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,
	  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to the CMake GUI so
	  users can enter values there instead of in the environment. - I
	  added OPENSCENEGRAPH_*_VERSION variables (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH).
	  These should be kept up-to-date with the real version numbers.
	  Mac bundles like to have version information so users can find
	  out the version they are running through standard About panels
	  and also automated system reporters for troubleshooting/bug
	  tracking. In theory, this information could be used for library
	  versioning. We should do the same for OpenThreads, but I forgot
	  about it. - I added some Mac Info.plist stuff (which uses the
	  version information). "

2007-04-27 09:49 +0000 [r6561]  robert:

	  Implemented the virtual methods in QuicktimeImageStream,
	  (getLength, getReferenceTime, setTimeMultiplier), to return valid
	  value for each. "

2007-04-26 08:07 +0000 [r6556]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, Added quicktime CMakeLists.txt

2007-04-25 18:50 +0000 [r6555]  robert:

	* From Martin Aumueller, fixed unused parameter warnings

2007-04-25 09:32 +0000 [r6550]  robert:

	* From Martin Aumueller, " a collegue of mine noticed that on
	  Windows and X11 the modifier state (such as Alt or Ctrl) would be
	  applied one key press too late: e.g. press & hold Alt, press a,
	  release Alt, press a, press a would generate the key sequence a,
	  Alt-a, a instead of Alt-a, a, a. The problem is also present on
	  Carbon. Moving the call to setModKeyMask in front of the call to
	  keyPress fixed it for me on Carbon and X11. I suppose that this
	  will fix the problem for Windows as well."

2007-04-25 09:21 +0000 [r6549]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, "These enhancements make it much easier to
	  control which libraries get found by FIND_ using environmental
	  variables. The problem with the old script was that CMake
	  searches what it considers system paths first. This makes it
	  difficult to override in the case where you might have a stable
	  version in /usr/local, but are trying to build a bleeding edge
	  release in the non-standard location /bleeding-edge. I went to
	  the CMake mailing list hoping to find a good solution to this.
	  Unfortunately, there isn't one, and I have to do something rather
	  bone-headed in the Find module. Basically, I have to run FIND_
	  twice: once with default search paths turned off and my
	  environmental variables listed, and again with standard search
	  paths reenabled. At least it works. I also added a few more
	  environmental variables, specifically: OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR These two variables address the
	  shortcoming of OPENTHREADS_DIR in the case where the include path
	  and library path don't share a common parent. Put all this
	  together, and you can setup an automated shell script or
	  Microsoft .bat file to configure and build your application in an
	  automated step. You still should be able to use the key CMake
	  variables like CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to find
	  things, but it will occur after the environmental paths are
	  searched. The reason for this is that the OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
	  and OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR are more specific. This prevents the
	  accidental ordering problem where you might use
	  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to find some other component like GLUT, but
	  didn't want to accidentally include an older version of
	  OpenThreads located in the same area. As the ultimate override,
	  you can still pass -DVAR=value arguments to cmake and it will
	  take these above all else. However, it's safer for people to not
	  use these in case we modify the script and change the variable
	  names. Finally, I'm wondering if we can kill the
	  ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} searches in the Find module. As I've said
	  before, this is kind of a hack and the variable wasn't really
	  intended to be used in this way. And I just got bitten by it in
	  some bad corner cases. The problem is that if you don't
	  explicitly set the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}, CMake sets a default
	  value for it (such as /usr/local). The problem is that /usr/local
	  may not be the place you want searched. If you wait to set the
	  ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} in the ccmake GUI, then FIND_ is already
	  run once on ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local. If you were
	  planning to change the value in the GUI, it's too late if you had
	  a stuff in /usr/local because FIND_ already found something and
	  won't change the value when you reconfigure since it is already
	  set. You will have to manually change the value yourself.
	  Furthermore, as another problem example, on the Mac,
	  /Library/Frameworks is supposed to be searched before /usr/local,
	  but ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} kept causing stuff in /usr/local to
	  be hit first which took me a really long time to understand how
	  this was happenning. The work around is that I must push the
	  ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} search to the very end as not to conflict
	  with anything else. But I think it would be much better if we
	  removed it entirely. And with so many different environmental
	  variables at our disposal, I don't think we need this one:
	  (Checked by CMake automatically:) CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
	  CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
	  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH PATH LIB (Checked by us:)

2007-04-25 09:16 +0000 [r6547-6548]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, "lwo must link to osgFX or undefined symbols
	  ensue."

	* From Eric Wing, "I made a mistake in my IF() checks for
	  FOO_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE. I was using
	  ${FOO_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE} instead of just
	  FOO_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE. In this case, it happened to work out to
	  still be correct, but in general it shouldn't have the ${}. (I
	  really hate this syntax.)"

2007-04-24 19:08 +0000 [r6545]  robert:

	* From Jeremy Moles, Added check for image transluceny to image
	  loaded code, placing the image quad into the transparent bin for
	  images with alpha values.

2007-04-24 19:03 +0000 [r6544]  robert:

	* From Martin Aumueller, "the new Inventor plugin needs some
	  changes in order to compile against OpenInventor. Just as in the
	  pre-r6419 I used the COIN_BASIC_H define in order to discriminate
	  between the two versions of Inventor. Additionally, I had to
	  change the CMakeLists.txt to use the proper include path. "

2007-04-24 13:12 +0000 [r6542-6543]  robert:

	* From Jan Peciva, "I was working on a new version of Inventor
	  plugin. It was inspired by the need to get correct and high
	  quality conversion, so I verified the plugin on complex models
	  and made number of serious fixes: - the geometry is not two times
	  on the output file (!) - SoVRMLImageTexture: VRML texture support
	  was rewritten according to Inventor programming practices, since
	  it does not worked correctly on many models (Anyway, thanks for
	  Gerrick Bivins to introduce it.) - osg::ref wrong usage related
	  crash fixed - code cleaning and texture code overhaul - LOD fixes
	  - appended README.txt with all the contributors I was able to get
	  from SVN logs"

	* From Michael Platings, "In the "new method" 3DS loader, inverse
	  matrices were applied to vertices, but not normals, which caused
	  some models to appear with normals doubly rotated. I've now added
	  some code to transform the normals."

2007-04-22 20:19 +0000 [r6514]  robert:

	* Unified the setup of version numbers so that they all are based
	  on the version number setup in the include/osg/Version header
	  file.

2007-04-21 12:29 +0000 [r6513]  robert:

	* Added osgSim dependency to txp plugin

	  context/window returned from Viewer::getContexts/getWindows will
	  be the left most window on the lowest screen number. Added
	  ability for StatsHandler and HelpHandler to support end users
	  setting their Camera's graphics context.

	* Added delay between sequential threading model changes to prevent
	  the system from locking up with 'm' is held down, which previous
	  would cause the threading model to be thrashed.

2007-04-16 19:40 +0000 [r6509]  robert:

	* From Jason Howlett, using suggestion from Robert Osfield,
	  "CullVisitor.cpp was modified, beginning at line 1115. Code was
	  added to check if the camera inherits its cull mask. If not, the

	* Added SETUP_COMMANDLINE_APPLICATION and SETUP_COMMANDLINE_EXAMPLE
	  macros

2007-04-12 09:33 +0000 [r6481-6483]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, "Attached is a patch allows access access to the
	  CMake MACOSX_BUNDLE option. Now SETUP_APPLICATION and
	  SETUP_EXAMPLE take an additional optional parameter that
	  specifies if the program is a command line application or a GUI
	  application (think: IS_COMMANDLINE_APP). Passing 1 means true
	  (is_commandline_app). Passing 0 or omitting the parameter means
	  false. I changed the scripts for osgversion and osgunittests to
	  support this option because I believe they are command line apps.
	  Are there any others?"

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Mike Wittman, fix to CopyOp&.

2007-04-12 09:18 +0000 [r6480]  robert:

	  elevation and colour layers having different locator

2007-04-11 08:35 +0000 [r6474-6475]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, " Changes include: A internal cache flag that can
	  be used to detect if this is the first time running the CMake
	  configuration. This is needed to work around stupid CMake UI
	  shortcomings about the UI not reflecting anything you SET unless
	  you use FORCE. But if you use FORCE, you override anything the
	  user may try to set/override unless you have an exception check.
	  It turns out the exception check you need is often the first-run
	  check. This flag is potentially useful for other things too. An
	  optional switch that turns on more aggressive warnings based on
	  your compiler. Some Apple specific stuff for detecting the OS
	  version and enabling Universal Binaries (and some additional
	  compiler flags that are good but gcc version dependent). The
	  version check code is unfortunately really fragile. I need to
	  lobby CMake to return the OS X version number for us. FYI,
	  building Universal will fail with the current CMake release due
	  to a bug, but is now fixed in CVS. "

	* Removed tabs

2007-04-10 13:58 +0000 [r6472]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, pedantic warning fixes

2007-04-06 14:40 +0000 [r6456-6458]  robert:

	* From Laurens Voerman, "I've added the code to set up quad_stereo
	  properly. I have tested with WinXP / VC8, stereo is working. I
	  also added code to set sampleBuffers and samples. These cannot
	  yet be properly set, tested (windows only ) by changing
	  _numMultiSamples in DisplaySettings::setDefaults() and
	  recompiling."

	* From Mike Wittman, "1. Disable suppression of osg::CullStack.
	  I've been building the osgWrapper code successfully with this
	  change on both Windows and Linux, but I believe you said you got
	  some (unspecified) errors when you tried it before. If it still
	  causes problems, could you post the errors so I can try to solve
	  them? 2. Change osg::GraphicsContext from object-type to
	  abstract-object-type. The current setting is incorrect because
	  the class is actually abstract."

	* From Laurens Voerman, "attached is
	  OpenSceneGraph\src\osgViewer\GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp I've added
	  the code to get the osgViewer working on windows displays with
	  less than 32 bit color. Only tested with 16 bit color."

2007-04-06 14:33 +0000 [r6455]  robert:

	* Added support 16bit intensity formats

2007-03-29 19:42 +0000 [r6435-6436]  robert:

	* Converted osg::HeightField across to using a osg::FloatArray
	  internally to enable it to be assigned as a vertex attribute
	  array to an osg::Geometry. Removed the osgTerrain::ArrayLayer as
	  its no longer required thanks to the above change which makes the

2007-03-28 08:43 +0000 [r6419]  robert:

	* From Martin Aumueller, "in order to remove a dependency on Coin3D
	  (which is GPLed) and make it work with SGI's OpenInventor, I had
	  to change OpenSceneGraph/src/osgPlugins/Inventor, as
	  SoVRMLImageTexture is not avaible in SGI's Inventor. " From
	  Robert Osfield, tweaked the above so that it uses Coin headers to
	  switch on coin features: #ifdef COIN_SOCALLBACKACTION_H #define
	  USE_COIN 1 #endif

2007-03-28 07:34 +0000 [r6418]  robert:

	* From Luigi Calori, added Find3rdPartyDependencies.cmake

2007-03-27 21:44 +0000 [r6417]  robert:

	* From Luigi Calori, "here is a patch to use Mike 3rdParty
	  dependencies It should not be introusive to any other palatform
	  apart MSVC, but in order to link to debug-specific libs I had to
	  change plugins CMakeLists to differentiate debug/release linkage,
	  I have used the same macro used in core libs Now the macro used
	  for plugin and examples linking test for existance of
	  TARGET_LIBRARIES_VARS that holds the names of the variables that
	  have to be used for linking"

2007-03-27 19:39 +0000 [r6416]  robert:

	* Added Locator and layer setting to osgterrain example

2007-03-26 13:02 +0000 [r6401-6402]  robert:

	* From Luigi Calori, "when we link against something that comes out
	  from a Find... we ususally have a variable
	  <LINK_VAR_NAME>available like OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY, so I' ve set
	  up a macro that uses the variable name expanded for linking, and
	  test if a variable ${LINK_VAR_NAME}_DEBUG like
	  OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DEBUG exists and in case uses it for linking
	  in debug mode. I' ve also set up FindOpenThreads to set up these
	  variables. I had to edit the core libraries CMakeLists to add the
	  calls to the macros used. I' ve tested under MSVC"

	* From Mike Wittman, "This is another weirdo change to support code
	  generation. It brings all the Drawable::supports and
	  Drawable::accepts overloads into the ShapeDrawable scope to avoid
	  errors invoking the ones that are not defined in ShapeDrawable.
	  Currently you'll get compilation errors if you pass a
	  Drawable::AttributeFunctor or PrimitiveIndexFunctor to the
	  "accept" function invoked on a ShapeDrawable pointer or
	  reference, since those overloads are only defined in the base
	  class. You'll also get the same error passing a
	  PrimitiveIndexFunctor to the "supports" function. These errors
	  occur because C++ function overload resolution does not cross
	  inheritance boundaries."

2007-03-26 09:48 +0000 [r6400]  robert:

	* Changed the external library specification to use
	  TARGET_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES

2007-03-25 11:47 +0000 [r6399]  robert:

	  prevent double linking of OpenThreadsd and OpenThreads during
	  debug build.

2007-03-23 17:37 +0000 [r6398]  robert:

	* From Mike Wittman, "This change fixes a couple bugs in the
	  osgIntrospection protected function support. I missed adding the
	  protected/public specifier on a couple recursive invocations, so
	  those functions are not currently returning protected functions
	  for base classes when they should."

2007-03-23 17:27 +0000 [r6397]  robert:

	* From Mike Wittman, remove redundent const from in front of

2007-03-16 14:28 +0000 [r6367-6368]  robert:

	* From David Callu, " bug: Lost the functionality to find the real
	  type pointed by a pointer. Ex: a osg::Node pointer point on a
	  osg::Group, if I look for information on the pointer type, the
	  introspection say it is a "osg::Node*". But if I want information
	  on the pointed type, the introspection must return the
	  "osg::Group". This bug come from the
	  osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function. In
	  the original version, this function use the member "Instance_base
	  *inst_" like this : typeof(*static_cast<Instance<T>
	  *>(inst_)->_data) But in the new version, this function use the
	  template argument "T": typeof(typename remove_pointer<T>::type)
	  This is a good meta-programming use, but here we need a dynamic
	  request. Moreover the "typeof" macro define in "Reflection"
	  header accept only a type in parameter with the new version. fix:
	  Add the macro "typeofvalue" in "Reflection" header which accept a
	  value or a type in parameter. Restore original code in
	  osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function. "

	  osg::Drawable::ConstAttributeFunctor, and
	  osg::StateAttribute::ModeUsage in osg and osgSim were not being
	  properly reflected in osgIntrospection. This appears to be due to
	  Doxygen not handling nested types from superclasses if they're
	  not qualified when referenced in subclasses. These changes add

	  the problem. In Creator the "Last Frame Duration" is performed on
	  the last frame of the last loop iteration, I tried to use it for
	  the last frame of every loop iteration. As you already have
	  explained we need a custom Sequence node. In the osgSim nodekit
	  we already have a couple of specialized nodes for the OpenFlight
	  format. We need an osgSim::GroupAnimation but I don't have the
	  time right now to take this challenge. Until then I have modified
	  my last attempt to work with the current osg::Sequence node by
	  ignoring the "Last Frame Duration".

2007-02-21 15:15 +0000 [r6250]  robert:

	* Wojciech Lewandowski: "TexGenNode::TexGenNode( TexGen * texGen )
	  constructor does not initialize ReferenceFrame. I am not sure
	  maybe this was the intent but first constructor does it so I

	* From Stephan Huber, "I added a bool to GraphicsContext::Traits to
	  indicate wether to use the multithreaded-opengl-engine on os x or
	  not. I set its default to false, perhaps other os x users can

	* Updated wrappers

	* From Mike Wittman, "Here is the next in the series of changes I'm
	  making to OSG introspection to support the attributes needed for
	  C# bindings. This change adds virtual/pure virtual attributes to

	* Changed osgManipulator::Dragger::handle(..) method to use a
	  nested PointerInfo class to encapsulate the pixel coords,

	  tweaks and rename for osgDragger to osgManipulator for build by
	  Robert Osfield. Vivek's email to osg-submissions: "I'm happy to
	  release the osgdragger nodekit to the OSG community. I
	  implemented the nodekit for my company, Fugro-Jason Inc., and
	  they have kindly agreed to open source it. The nodekit contains a
	  few draggers but it should be easy to build new draggers on top
	  of it. The design of the nodekit is based on a SIGGRAPH 2002
	  course - "Design and Implementation of Direct Manipulation in
	  3D". You can find the course notes at
	  http://www.pauliface.com/Sigg02/index.html. Reading pages 20 - 29
	  of the course notes should give you a fair understanding of how
	  the nodekit works. The source code also contains an example of
	  how to use the draggers."

2007-02-10 18:01 +0000 [r6142]  robert:

	* From Vivek Rajan, MatrixDecomposition implementaion, adapted by

	* Moved the basic ShadowVolume code into osgShadow

2007-02-09 14:54 +0000 [r6137]  robert:

	* From Yefei He, " I wrote a class derived from CopyOp that
	  preserves the multi-parent structure of scene graphs. I only
	  considered the case of DEEP_COPY_NODES, but it is sufficient for
	  me. It is not the most elegant way -- I used a map to list all
	  the already cloned nodes with multiple parents, to be looked up
	  whenever such a node is revisited. The good part is, it works."
	  From Robert Osfield, fixed build problems under Linux 64 due to
	  use of int's to store Node* in internal maps used in above custom
	  CopyOp. Added ref_ptr<> usage to main to prevent memory leaks

	* Removed debug message

2007-02-08 22:36 +0000 [r6131]  robert:

	* From André Garneau, "Attached is a fix for the hang occuring on
	  Win32 when the thread model is changed. The issue was caused by
	  the mutex in the ViewerDoubleBufferRenderingOperation being
	  released even though they were not owned. This was causing the
	  underlying critical section object lock count values becoming
	  negative; the next time the lock was acquired it would block
	  because of that."

2007-02-08 22:31 +0000 [r6130]  robert:

	* From Brian Keener, fixes for Cygwin filename handling

2007-02-08 20:30 +0000 [r6129]  robert:

	* From Charles Cole, "The program database filename was changed for
	  the osgviewer application such as to not conflict with the
	  program database file generated by the core osgViewer library.
	  This change allows for both the application and library to be
	  used in debugging mode within Visual Studio. This change has been
	  tested with Visual Studio 2005 (VS8)."

	* Added setting of the DatabasePager's affinity.

2007-02-08 10:46 +0000 [r6114]  robert:

	* From Donn Mielcarek, "We generated some bad ive files in our
	  database. In some of the files, the function readInt() would
	  return a 0 size. While linux will happily continue on, creating 0
	  sized arrays, Windows immediately blows up, with sparks sometimes
	  flying out the side of the machine! I added a simple check for
	  zero size in each of the functions that allocates arrays based on
	  the size variable, and I thought I'd pass it along. Now the
	  program will not die if it encounters an ive file with bad data."

2007-02-07 21:56 +0000 [r6113]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-02-07 21:48 +0000 [r6112]  robert:

	  accept() method checking the nodemask as it should.

2007-02-06 20:03 +0000 [r6106]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "thomas kirk schrieb: > I put this at the end
	  of realizeImplementation; someone with better knowledge > of
	  Carbon programming may see a more appropriate place for the call.
	  I moved your code into the ctor of the
	  OSXCarbonWindowingSystemInterface so it get called only once. Can
	  you test it again, if it works on your side? I also disabled
	  multithreaded-rendering because it slowed down the rendering on
	  my machine by a factor of 3. Perhaps we can make it optional to
	  test it on other machines. I had some problems implementing
	  pbuffer-support for os x and stopped it for now until I have more
	  time to investigate the issues. "

2007-02-06 11:03 +0000 [r6097]  robert:

	* Further work on support for ThreadPerCamera, and improved the
	  efficiency of SingleThraeded

2007-02-05 14:56 +0000 [r6095]  robert:

	* Tweak API and updated wrappers to get wrappers to build

2007-02-05 13:44 +0000 [r6094]  robert:

	* Added Camera's s/getCameraThread() and updated wrappers

2007-02-05 12:13 +0000 [r6093]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-02-05 11:48 +0000 [r6092]  robert:

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, "I have attached the 3 files we had to
	  change to fix a proble we were seeing with using Symbol Fonts //
	  GT: fix for symbol fonts (i.e. the Webdings font) as the wrong
	  character are being // returned, for symbol fonts in windows
	  (FT_ENCONDING_MS_SYMBOL in freetype) the correct // values are
	  from 0xF000 to 0xF0FF not from 0x000 to 0x00FF (0 to 255) as you
	  would expect. // becuase Microsoft uses a private field for its
	  symbol fonts ........ "

2007-02-05 11:14 +0000 [r6091]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "I have made some changes to support light
	  sources in the new OpenFlight loader."

2007-02-05 10:48 +0000 [r6090]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, added OSG_EXPORT to DeleteHandler for
	  windows build

2007-02-05 10:44 +0000 [r6089]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Here's my changes to Registry to allow
	  extension alias mapping via a config file. I also attached a
	  sample file that tests the parsing, but this is just FYI and not
	  for inclusion in CVS. To set up extension aliases using a config
	  file, an app calls:
	  osgDB::Registry::instance()->readPluginAliasConfigurationFile(),
	  passing in the file name as the parameter. (Of course this should
	  be done before loading any files whose names depend on the
	  mapping.) osgDB will search for the file using OSG_FILE_PATH. The
	  file should contain a line for each mapping, with the "map"
	  extension first, followed by a space or tab, then the plugin
	  identifier. For example, a file containing this line: flt
	  OpenFlight would map the ".flt" extension to the OpenFlight
	  plugin."

2007-02-02 22:30 +0000 [r6088]  robert:

	* Convert GraphicsThread/GraphicsOperation to more generic
	  OperationsThread/Operation. This paves the way to running cull
	  traversals in seperate threads. Updated wrappers

2007-02-02 16:51 +0000 [r6087]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowski, added support for the new Text line spacing
	  parameter to the .osg and .ive formats.

2007-02-02 12:41 +0000 [r6086]  robert:

	* Added a concrete osg::DeleteHandler implementation which provides
	  support for retain objects for several frames before deleting
	  them. Also added RenderStageCache into CullVistor.cpp that is
	  used for handling RTT osg::Camera's that are being used in double
	  buffered SceneView usage.

2007-02-01 11:07 +0000 [r6084-6085]  robert:

	* Improved the toggling on/off of thrading modes

	* Moved the init traversal from cull() to the draw() to prevent
	  graphics context calls being made during the cull traversal -
	  something that breaks the ThreadPerCamera model in osgViewer

2007-01-31 22:24 +0000 [r6083]  robert:

	* Further work on new threading model.

2007-01-31 11:12 +0000 [r6082]  robert:

	* Removed old #if #else #end block

2007-01-30 17:38 +0000 [r6081]  robert:

	* Refactored the ViewerRenderingOperation so that the timer querry
	  code is in a separate ViewerQuerySupport class

2007-01-30 17:12 +0000 [r6080]  robert:

	* Added display listing of ShadowVolume

2007-01-30 15:37 +0000 [r6079]  robert:

	* Added automatic aspect ratio adjustmeent to
	  View::setUpViewAcrossAllScreens() and setUpViewOnSingleScreen.

	* Updated wrappers

2007-01-30 14:32 +0000 [r6077]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolwsky, "osgText is a useful node kit, but when
	  longer paragraphs are displayed on the screen, it looks more
	  aesthetically pleasing to have a larger gap between lines than is
	  given by default. I added a new parameter, lineSpacing, in the
	  Text class to allow the line spacing to be adjustable by the
	  application. The default value is 0 meaning there is no extra
	  spacing given. The value should be given as a percentage of the
	  character height. A good value for longer paragraphs is 0.25
	  (25%) or more."

2007-01-30 14:18 +0000 [r6076]  robert:

	* From Bryan Thrall, "The osgDB::ReaderWriter and
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options classes have copy constructors that
	  take a const osg::CopyOp rather than a osg::CopyOp&, forcing an
	  unnecessary copy. The attached header fixes this, based off OSG
	  1.2. Also fixed duplicate "or" openArchive()'s comment."

2007-01-30 13:48 +0000 [r6075]  robert:

	* Added support for compute average stats attributes in inverse
	  space to improve the quality of frame rate reporting.

2007-01-30 12:09 +0000 [r6074]  robert:

	* Disabled the alternating directions of drawing of state sorted
	  render leaves as it was interferring with anaglyphic stereo used
	  in the osgstereimage example.

2007-01-30 11:47 +0000 [r6073]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-01-30 11:40 +0000 [r6072]  robert:

	* Added Stats::collectStats(string,bool) controls,
	  getAveragedAttribute methods into osg::Stats class, and related
	  support into osgViewer::Viewer and osgViewer::StatsHandler. Added
	  lazy updating of text in StatsHandler HUD to minimize the impact
	  of slow text updating on observed frame rates.

2007-01-30 09:55 +0000 [r6071]  robert:

	* Added support for per frame alternating the direction that
	  SORT_BY_STATE bins are rendered. The alternation makes it more
	  likely that OpenGL objects will still be in video ram.

2007-01-29 22:59 +0000 [r6070]  robert:

	* Made _useMainThreadForRenderingalTraversal(false)

2007-01-29 22:44 +0000 [r6069]  robert:

	* Began work on providing support for threading camera cull
	  traversals in parallel with the previous frames draw traversal.
	  Changes range from osg::State, through osgUtil::RenderBin,
	  through to osgViewer

2007-01-28 17:32 +0000 [r6068]  robert:

	* Added very simple relaxing of traits by dividing required red,
	  green, blue, alpha and depth by 2.

2007-01-28 17:12 +0000 [r6066-6067]  robert:

	* Added use of Viewe Realize graphics operation.

	* Added set/getRealizeOperation() to Viewer and CompositeViewer

2007-01-28 09:53 +0000 [r6065]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-01-28 09:30 +0000 [r6064]  robert:

	* From Vlad Danciu, fixed leaf depth sort functor

2007-01-28 09:17 +0000 [r6063]  robert:

	* From Mike Wittman, "This file removes the virtual destructor of
	  osgText::String. It seemed wrong that osgText::String should have
	  a vtable since it is treated like a value type, and any
	  subclasses containing additional data would effectively be
	  subject to slicing during standard usage. This stuck out as an
	  anomaly when classifying the OSG types for C# bindings."

2007-01-27 17:57 +0000 [r6062]  robert:

	* Added osg::PolygonMode to local StateSet to protect it from being
	  affected by stateset manipulator.

2007-01-27 17:52 +0000 [r6061]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Added _sorted flag into RenderBin to prevent a bin being sorted
	  twice in one frame

2007-01-27 11:13 +0000 [r6056]  robert:

	* Changed osgUtil::RenderBin and osg::State to allow nesting of
	  StateSet's associated with RenderBin's.

2007-01-26 21:22 +0000 [r6055]  robert:

	* Further work on building the rendering back end from the intial
	  traversal of the scene graph

2007-01-26 16:08 +0000 [r6054]  robert:

	  osg_SimulationTime and osg_DeltaSimulationTime to the uniforms
	  set by SceneView Added frame(double simulationTime) and
	  advance(double simulationTime) parameters to
	  osgViewer::SimpleViewer, Vewer and CompositeViewer. Updated
	  various examples and Nodes to use SimulationTime where
	  appropriate.

2007-01-25 10:02 +0000 [r6050]  robert:

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, fixes to
	  BoundingSphere::expandBy(BoundingSphere&)

2007-01-24 12:59 +0000 [r6049]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-01-24 12:35 +0000 [r6048]  robert:

	* From Martin Spott, "To enable osgviewer to link on Solaris added
	  -lmtsk as SunOS/SunStudio implements some threading stuff in
	  libmtsk."

2007-01-24 12:28 +0000 [r6047]  robert:

	* Added support for GUIEventAdapter::setHandled

2007-01-24 12:21 +0000 [r6046]  robert:

	* Added setHandled/getHandled to osgGA::GUIEventAdapter

2007-01-24 11:18 +0000 [r6045]  robert:

	* Added ability to generate various cube faces for testing and
	  switch handler to toggle between different models.

2007-01-24 10:02 +0000 [r6044]  robert:

	* From André Garneau, " * Setup proper pixel format for ATI boards
	  (removal of WGL_SWAP_METHOD_ARB specification from the requested
	  pixel format since unsupported by the ATI driver) * Fix to create
	  sample OpenGL window on the proper display device. This is the
	  temporary window used to choose the desired pixel format. In the
	  previous version, this window was always created on the primary
	  display device, even though it had potentially different pixel
	  formats compared to the target display device containing the
	  window to be created. * Implementation of
	  WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenResolution() method *
	  Implementation of
	  WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenRefreshRate() method *
	  Implementation of GraphicsWindow::requestWarpPointer() method *
	  Implementation of GraphicsWindow::useCursor() method and
	  associated trait support. This can be used in two ways; first,
	  when the graphics trait requested indicates that no cursor should
	  be present, a new cursor-less window class is used to create the
	  window. When a cursor-enabled window creation is requested,
	  another window class is used. After creation of a window, it is
	  also possible to toggle the cursor state by using the
	  GraphicsWindow::useCursor method. * The way the mouse behaves is
	  now compatible with the behaviour seen on X11; i.e. when pressing
	  a mouse button, the window where the pointer is located will
	  capture the mouse input and release it only after the button has
	  been released. This results in all mouse movement events being
	  dispatched to the window where the button was pressed initially
	  until it is released. This improves the interaction with graphics
	  windows. * Preparation work has been done to support the ability
	  of moving a window from one screen to another screen and
	  recreating its rendering context when this happens. This has been
	  tested with a mix of NVIDIA and ATI cards and works properly. For
	  the moment being, this feature is commented out due to changes in
	  the core OSG libraries that have been done but need to be
	  submitted later this week for approval by Robert. Upcoming
	  features * Support for moving windows from one screen to another
	  screen seamlessly * Ability to set the window (i.e. the
	  application itself creates the rendering window and passes it to
	  the GraphicsWindowWin32 class) * Other miscellaneous items"

	* Updated wrappers

	* Commented out the default saving of models

	* Added osg::StateSet* parameter to constructor to make it more
	  convinient to set up the StateSetManipulator and moved the
	  initialization of locally cached states into the handle method to
	  ensure a representative version of the StateSet is captured

2007-01-23 16:02 +0000 [r6037]  robert:

	* Added stats and range of keyboard mouse handling to osgshadow
	  example

2007-01-23 11:56 +0000 [r6029]  robert:

	* Added ability to customize the keys used to control stats

	* Improvements to stats

2007-01-22 09:28 +0000 [r6022]  robert:

	* From Mathias Fröhlich, "Attached is a small change that makes the
	  txf loader render the same resulting text than an other well
	  known txf loader. That means drawing them one on top of the other
	  I can only see differences due to different mipmapping ... That
	  is it introduces an additional gap of 0.1*height between the
	  glyphs. There is an additional mapping between upper and
	  lowercase characters if one of them is not available in the txf
	  file. And we have an artificial blank character that is very
	  often missing in txf files."

2007-01-21 20:41 +0000 [r6021]  robert:

	* Further work on stats

2007-01-21 18:46 +0000 [r6020]  robert:

	  operations

2007-01-18 09:56 +0000 [r6008]  robert:

	* From André Garneau, "Attached is a fix in the GraphicsWindowWin32
	  class to allow the following usage pattern to work properly;
	  create window, delete window, create window, etc. In all the
	  tests I made I was always creating-deleting and then shutting
	  down the application so this pattern was untested. The
	  osgtexture3d & osgsimulation examples were also using this
	  pattern so would not work. They are working fine now."

2007-01-18 09:03 +0000 [r6007]  robert:

2007-01-15 10:11 +0000 [r5986]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "The OpenFlight loader already have a
	  caching mechanism for externals. The cache works for nested
	  externals but is cleared before the master flight file is
	  returned. I implemented texture caching using the same
	  mechanism."

2007-01-15 09:56 +0000 [r5985]  robert:

	* Added releaseContext to end of GraphicsThread::run()

2007-01-12 22:07 +0000 [r5981]  robert:

	* From Riccardo Corsi, "this should be the final version of the
	  qt-plugin ported to windows and cleaned up to avoid crashes on
	  exit. Stephan and I tested it on Mac and Win. Just a couple of
	  notes: * the plugin is able to load both regular 2D images and
	  movie stream. There is a #define QT_HANDLE_IMAGES_ALSO mechanism
	  to indicate whether to use it for images or not. This is defined
	  by default on Mac only, to avoid conflicts with the standard
	  windows plugins. See comments on QTUtils.h * de-initialization of
	  quicktime before exit is now left to an observer, which calls
	  exitQuicktime() when last media loaded with the plugin is
	  released. This prevent a crash on exit without need of any extra
	  call external to the plugin."

	  include/osgParticle/ParticleSystem. I replaced
	  Particle(ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp) with ptemplate?
	  *ptemplate: _def_ptemp in a couple of places. This should make
	  particle creation and reuse go a little faster without all that
	  memory allocation and copying."

2007-01-12 21:33 +0000 [r5978]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "New features: + Multi-display-support +
	  automatic hiding of the menubar/dock if one of the windows
	  intersects the menubar/dock Bugfixes: + event-handling was done
	  by the first opened window, other windows did not receive events
	  -- fixed + mouse-coordinates were absolute, now they are relative
	  to the window. known bugs: + windows with decoration and in
	  fullscreen-size are moved by the system a little bit, so that the
	  titlebar is accessible/visible. So if you want real
	  fullscreen-windows, don't decorate the window :) I updated the
	  XCode-project-file so all ported examples are linked against
	  osgViewer."

2007-01-09 11:42 +0000 [r5949]  robert:

	* From Geoff Michel, "New delaunay triangulator attached. I hadn't
	  realised that the erase() method was not erase (first, last) but
	  erase (first, one after the last one you want deleted). This made
	  a big difference; however some of the edges of the terrain were
	  not included as edges in the terrain so I increased the size of
	  the supertriangle, which works but reduces accuracy due to the
	  larger range of coordinates in the supertriangle. (A larger
	  supertriangle forces the triangles using supertriangle vertices
	  to be long and thin, making the triangulation fit the convex hull
	  of the terrain.) The loss of accuracy should not affect 'normal'
	  users with terrains that are roughly square (say up to 100:1
	  aspect ratio) and where the Z range is comparable to the X-Y
	  range. Retested with Pauls data, amalric's strange polygon
	  constraint and the standard test constraints. I also added 2
	  tests for routines with a NULL argument passed to them (no-one
	  would usually pass a NULL pointer to these routines unless - as I
	  did in testing- you remove some of the constraints but still pass
	  their pointer to the routine). And I removed 3 tests for
	  triangles which are already removed when generating the geometry.
	  NB Paul - the previous delaunay triangulator fails under VS8 IF
	  it has any constraints as it attempts to use some vertices that
	  have already been deleted when applying the constraints to edges.
	  Under VS6 and less rigorous compilers it works as the deleted
	  vertices are still in the points stl::Vector; however any added
	  vertices would replace one of the supertriangle vertices with
	  non-disastrous but wrong results." Note, merged with latest name
	  changes in CVS.

	  complained to me about them since I posted them on the users list
	  last week."

2006-12-19 17:30 +0000 [r5830]  robert:

	* From Mathias Fröhlich, "I have a small update to the 'non convex
	  polygon detection' in the ac3d loader that is used to tell if
	  tesselation is required or if we will better leave a polygon as
	  is. It is still not perfect but catches some more cases."

2006-12-19 17:16 +0000 [r5829]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "minor code comment cleaup/rewording"

2006-12-19 17:06 +0000 [r5828]  robert:

	* From Orhun Birsoy, "In SimpleViewer::frameUpdateTraversal
	  function, orthographicCamera calculation has some typos. It
	  should read bool orthographicCamera = (pm(0,3)==0.0) &&

	  osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp These mods should allow to build terrains
	  controlling jpeg compressed imagery embedded in ive files, using
	  something like: osgdemd --image-ext jpeg --RGB_24 -O
	  "JPEG_QUALITY 20 compressImageData" ......."

2006-12-07 10:09 +0000 [r5810]  robert:

	* From Geoff Michel, "I was getting triangulations with the
	  previous delaunay triangulator, but it seems I may have been
	  picking up the wrong coordinates or an old version of my test
	  file (that version is OK when no coordinates lie outside the
	  'terrain' zone). This version is much stricter about memory
	  handling and insertion of extra points."

2006-12-06 21:39 +0000 [r5809]  robert:

	* From Gerrick Bivins, fixed newly introduced texture setup bug.

	  windows port

2006-12-06 14:17 +0000 [r5806]  robert:

	* From Rick Pingry, "n my application I am walking through the
	  scene graph looking for nodes of a specific name. I noticed there
	  were times when some of the nodes were not named what I had
	  expected. Upon reviewing the code, I noticed this was happening
	  when there was a forward reference to a parented object. The
	  existing code uses a map with object ID's. The original code only
	  applied the name to a node for a new ID only if the node did not
	  already exist in the map. The problem was that there was another
	  part of the code (when a parent was forward declared) that also
	  created the node with the ID in the map, but it did not know its
	  name. I simply made sure that the name was set regardless of
	  whether or not the node was already in the map. "

2006-12-05 22:10 +0000 [r5805]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-12-05 20:30 +0000 [r5804]  robert:

	* Checked in remaining element from Brede Johansen changes for
	  clmapToEdge reader option.

2006-12-05 17:30 +0000 [r5803]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "minor bugfixes for the quicktime-plugin"

2006-12-05 17:27 +0000 [r5802]  robert:

	* From Gerrick Bivins, "Changes: --merged with fixes for texture
	  coordinates(is this in CVS/SVN already)? --changed above
	  mentioned fix output level from osg::NOTIFY to osg::DEBUG_INFO
	  --added support for VRML97 ImageTextures. --changed pointers to
	  ref_pointers where possible. --added format (method separated by
	  "//////") for easier reading."

2006-12-05 17:10 +0000 [r5801]  robert:

	* From Roger James,"I have had another go at the windows specific
	  file name handling in daeWMaterials.cpp. I think I have arrived
	  at a temporary compromise. I have decided to just normalise the
	  drive letter part of file names for the time being and also
	  ensure that names of the format x:/xxxxx are treated as absolute
	  paths. This will cover a lot of cases. I have raised a bug
	  against collada which hopefully should resolve some others.
	  However there are some pathological cases which I have commented
	  on in the code, these will probably never work properly unless
	  there is a significant rewrite of the daeURI functionality.
	  Hopefully they are rare."

2006-12-05 16:45 +0000 [r5800]  robert:

	* From Rein Kadijk, "While displaying a certain scene, OsgEdit
	  crashed in ProxyNode::traverse() in file
	  OSG_OP_OT-1.2\OpenSceneGraph\src\osg\proxynode.cpp. It turned out
	  that nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler() returned NULL; using this
	  pointer to call one of DatabaseRequestHandler's methods is of
	  course illegal. I patched it by adding: if
	  (nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler())" From Robert Osfield, reordered
	  the addition of the nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler() check to allow
	  the default traverse() to be called when no database handling is
	  attached to the visitor.

2006-12-05 16:29 +0000 [r5799]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber and Riccardo Corsi, port of QuickTime plugin
	  to Windows

2006-12-05 15:41 +0000 [r5798]  robert:

	* Added use of typedef to help clean up the readability a little
	  and replaced a copy list with a reference.

2006-12-05 15:31 +0000 [r5797]  robert:

	* From Sylvain Marie, "changed raw pointers to smart pointers in
	  the dxfBlock, dxfTables and dxfSection classes, so their members
	  data are correctly deleted. - changed some methods signatures to
	  pass arguments by reference instead of by value. The performance
	  and memory usage are enhanced (the reader was clogging the heap
	  when reading some large DXF files) The updated files have been
	  compiled and tested with a variety of DXF files on XP with
	  VS2003, but the changes should not disturb any other compiler."

2006-12-05 14:58 +0000 [r5796]  robert:

	* From Chris McGlone, "PlygonZ copy constructor: added allocation
	  and copying of zarray"

2006-12-05 14:50 +0000 [r5795]  robert:

	* From Bryan Thrall, "Currently, the DatabasePager always loads
	  requested Nodes using the default Registry Options object, but it
	  would be useful to be able to request loading with a different
	  Options object. The attached files allow you to do that (based
	  off the OSG 1.2 source). For example, I'm implementing a loader
	  that requires context information when it pages in subgraphs,
	  which becomes significantly complicated when multiple scenegraphs
	  are requesting subgraph loads with different contexts (the loader
	  needs to know which context to use, and the Registry Options
	  needs to be carefully managed so the context settings don't
	  clobber each other, especially in multithreaded situations).
	  Being able to pass an Options instance along with the Node
	  request resolves this problem."

2006-12-05 14:28 +0000 [r5794]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "added a new reader option to replace the
	  texture wrap mode CLAMP with CLAMP_TO_EDGE."

	  the shadow volumes

2006-11-29 22:00 +0000 [r5778]  robert:

	* Added handling of loops

2006-11-29 21:43 +0000 [r5777]  robert:

	* From Per Fahlberg, added support for writing 16-bit rgb images

2006-11-29 14:33 +0000 [r5775]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-29 14:21 +0000 [r5774]  robert:

	* Further work on PlaneIntersector

2006-11-29 11:00 +0000 [r5773]  robert:

	* Added dummy virtual method implementations

2006-11-29 10:51 +0000 [r5772]  robert:

	* Cleaned up inheritance

2006-11-29 09:18 +0000 [r5771]  robert:

	* From Zach Deedler, added missing IntersectionVisitor

2006-11-28 16:50 +0000 [r5765-5766]  robert:

	* Removed redundent wrapper

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-28 16:30 +0000 [r5764]  robert:

	* Moved osgUtil::PolytopeIntersector, osgUtil::PlaneIntersector and
	  osgUtil::LineSegmentIntersector out from
	  include/osgUtil/IntersecionVisitor into their own seperate files.

2006-11-28 16:00 +0000 [r5763]  robert:

	* Added support for float or double osg::Plane, and the default
	  osg::Plane to double. Performance tests on big models did not
	  indicate any performance penalty in using doubles over floats, so
	  the move to doubles should mainly impact precision improvements
	  for whole earth databases. Also made improvements to
	  osgUtil::PlaneIntersector and osgSim::ElevationSlice classes

2006-11-28 11:10 +0000 [r5762]  robert:

	* Fixed fade text memory consumption bug which was due to new
	  RenderInfo being created local to RenderStage and passed on to
	  rendering code which populated the RenderInfo UserData, but
	  without the restoring the new UserData to the main RenderInfo.
	  The local RenderInfo UserData is now passed back to the main
	  RenderInfo.

2006-11-28 10:31 +0000 [r5761]  robert:

	* Removed the now redundent dateUtils.h file.

2006-11-28 09:14 +0000 [r5760]  robert:

	* Added missing Camera.h and removed redundent CameraNode.h

2006-11-27 20:25 +0000 [r5759]  robert:

	* Added beginnings of osgUtil::PlaneIntersector and
	  osgSim::ElevationSlice

2006-11-27 16:25 +0000 [r5758]  robert:

	* Added QWidget style constructor parameters

2006-11-27 14:52 +0000 [r5757]  robert:

	* Renamed osg::CameraNode to osg::Camera, cleaned up osg::View.
	  Added beginnings of new
	  osgViewer::Scene,View,Viewer,CompositeViewer and
	  GraphicsWindowProxy files.

2006-11-27 11:25 +0000 [r5756]  robert:

	* From Mauricio Hofmam, added support for reading images from all
	  osg::CameraNode attachments in RenderStage.

2006-11-27 09:23 +0000 [r5755]  robert:

	* From André Garneau, "The file submitted includes a fix to
	  properly support DDS textures compressed under the DXT-1 format
	  when they contain alpha information. Under this mode, each 4x4
	  texel block can selectively use an alpha component or none. When
	  alpha-enabled blocks are present, this is not reported in the
	  DDPF_ALPHAPIXELS bit in the pixel format flags causing the
	  reader-writer to report the file as a 3-components file
	  (GL_COMPRESSED_RGB_S3TC_DXT1_EXT). The fix requires looking at
	  each 4x4 texel block to detect the presence of 1-bit alpha
	  encoding. When such a block is found, the internal & pixel
	  formats are reported as GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT instead.
	  See
	  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/Opaque_and_1_Bit_Alpha_Textures.asp
	  for more information."

2006-11-26 22:27 +0000 [r5754]  robert:

	* Removed check from objectDeleted(void*) method as this was not
	  catching cases where the registered ptr was different from the
	  deleted ptr - something that can happen with multiple
	  inheritance.

2006-11-26 14:17 +0000 [r5753]  robert:

	* Missed check of changes to the RemoveRedundentNodesVisitor

2006-11-24 21:19 +0000 [r5752]  robert:

	* Added extra checks to RemoveRedendentVisitor to catch Groups that
	  may only have one child, but also have StateSet's etc and thefore
	  not suitable for removal.

2006-11-24 21:10 +0000 [r5751]  robert:

	* Added isIdentity() method

	  interface.

2006-11-23 21:32 +0000 [r5748]  robert:

	* Improved the ShadowVolumeGeometry orientations.

2006-11-23 17:29 +0000 [r5747]  robert:

	* Add compute of tight bounding box to enable better placement of
	  the base plane.

2006-11-23 16:55 +0000 [r5746]  robert:

	* First cut at generating the ShadowVolumeGeometry

2006-11-23 11:22 +0000 [r5745]  robert:

	* Added basic silhoette detection

2006-11-22 21:11 +0000 [r5743-5744]  robert:

	* From Roger James, "fixes mostly related to texture handling."

	* From Paul Martz, add OSG_FILE_PATH to end of setting of
	  OSG_FILE_PATH to preserve any previous settings

2006-11-22 20:52 +0000 [r5742]  robert:

	* From Paul de Repentigny, "When calling osgdem with argument
	  "--image-ext", the application just returns after loading the
	  proper ReaderWriter for the given extension." Fix was to remove
	  the erroenous return.

2006-11-22 20:47 +0000 [r5741]  robert:

	* From Sylvan Marie, "I attached my revised dxfEntity.cpp file from
	  the DXF plugin with the 2 following improvements: - When all
	  unsupported entities (SOLIDS, TEXT, ...) have been filtered out
	  from a block, dxfInsert::drawScene() was crashing because it
	  assumed that the block was not empty. It now returns silently so
	  the other blocks can still be imported. - The DXF reader assumed
	  all vertices were read first, then the face indices. But, from
	  the DXF "documentation" (www.autodesk.com/dxf) : "Polyface meshes
	  created with the PFACE command are always generated with all the
	  vertex coordinate entities first, followed by the face definition
	  entities. The code within AutoCAD that processes polyface meshes
	  requires this ordering. Programs that generate polyface meshes in
	  DXF should generate all the vertices then all the faces. However,
	  programs that read polyface meshes from DXF should be tolerant of
	  odd vertex and face ordering." So now the importer ignores the
	  posted number of vertices and face indices, and uses the size of
	  the lists instead."

2006-11-22 20:39 +0000 [r5740]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, Added missing initialization of the
	  _scaleByTextureRectangleSize variable in two of its constructors.

2006-11-21 16:59 +0000 [r5736-5737]  robert:

	* Added compute and visualization of triangle and vertex normals

	* Replaced the setTextureUnit(0) call in State::reset() with code
	  that just sets the member variables without requiring a graphics
	  context.

2006-11-21 16:16 +0000 [r5734-5735]  robert:

	* Added removeDuplicates function

	* Reordered methods to make associated functions clearer.

2006-11-21 14:42 +0000 [r5733]  robert:

	* Renamed osgviewer-Info.plist to osgviewerApplication-Info.plist
	  to prevent svn naming collision problems under Windows due t
	  osgviewer/osgViewer case insentive file name collisions.

2006-11-20 21:48 +0000 [r5732]  robert:

	* Added nested files

	  message.

2006-11-14 19:29 +0000 [r5716]  robert:

	* Added note about license or file, and link to specs.

2006-11-14 19:19 +0000 [r5714-5715]  robert:

	* Removed redundent osgac3.h file.

2006-11-14 17:24 +0000 [r5713]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-14 16:59 +0000 [r5712]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, add use of the autodetection of windowing size
	  support in SDL-version 1.2.10 and later. From Robert Osfield,
	  made the above an optional compile as it breaks apps based on
	  previous version of SDL.

2006-11-14 16:37 +0000 [r5711]  robert:

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Improovments: - does proper edge
	  detection with the crease angle given in the ac file - the reader
	  is much more verbose in case of broken files - no more static
	  variables - std::stream based - much faster, up to a factor of 50
	  for a polygonal test model - if the file contains polygonal
	  surfaces the loaded geometry is still polygonal as long as the
	  polygons are convex. Concave polygons are still tesselated.
	  Rationale: If the user needs triangular models he can throw away
	  that extra information with the osgUtil::Optimizer himself. But
	  the read step preserves as much extra information that is
	  contained in the file as possible. Also the polygonal models look
	  a bit smoother than the triangular ones. - a huge cleanup - the
	  basic parsing logic from the original ac3d developer is untouched
	  - the writer part is untouched The tarball contains a replacement
	  for the src/osgPlugins/ac3d directory that is based on the
	  current CVS (2006-11-13). I have tested that loader with a
	  osgconv foo.ac /tmp/xx.ive on everyfoo. ac file I could find
	  (~200 from flightgear and the object database). I also run my
	  flightgear development with that loader -> here I see the models.
	  I run valgrind testcases on some selected models."

2006-11-14 15:06 +0000 [r5710]  robert:

	* Added osgViewer depdendency to osgintersection, osgGLUT* examples

2006-11-14 12:55 +0000 [r5709]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, "I ran though the sample data that Gert
	  provided earlier today and tracked down the problem. The xoffset
	  in readHeightField and readImage were being applied even in
	  projected coordinate systems. This patch should fix the issue."

2006-11-14 12:51 +0000 [r5707-5708]  robert:

	* Further migration to using RenderInfo

	* From Stephan Huber, Follows is required to prevent unidented
	  cloning of shared arrays : "I added some calls to
	  isOperationPermissibleForObject() so I can permit the
	  flattten-pass with my specialized objects in my own code."

2006-11-14 12:29 +0000 [r5706]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "This patch adds a CoordOriginMode to the
	  osg::PointSprite attribute. The mode needs to be changed to
	  LOWER_LEFT when rendering point sprites to pbuffers or FBOs,
	  otherwise the points will be transformed on the CPU."

2006-11-14 12:16 +0000 [r5705]  robert:

	* Added support for handling osg::ShapeDrawable style drawables in
	  OccluderGeoemtry.

	* Added better handling of writeNode operations that arn't
	  successful.

	* Fixed the writeNode function so it was properly return
	  FILE_NOT_HANDLED, fixing a big with it writing out an empty .flt
	  file.

2006-11-07 14:26 +0000 [r5695]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-07 13:48 +0000 [r5694]  robert:

	* Ben van Basten, "1 Bug fix in reuseParticle where originally an
	  old particle that was already killed would be killed again, but
	  instead should have been placed on the dead stack for future
	  reuse. 2 Getter/setter for _maxNumberOfParticlesToSkip that is
	  used for filtering of particles during draw. This enables you to
	  turn the filtering of by setting this value to zero. 3 Getter for
	  retrieval of the first particle in the trail. This allows you to
	  directly manipulate the trail from your application by walking
	  from the start particle towards the end of the trail." Submitted
	  on Ben's behalf by Roland Smeenk.

2006-11-07 13:43 +0000 [r5693]  robert:

2006-11-06 13:22 +0000 [r5688]  robert:

	* Thanks to Björn Hein for spotting mistakes in EventQueue.cpp and
	  StateSetManipulator, now fixed by Robert Osfield. Problems were:
	  "StateSetManipulator.cpp (rev 1.12, l. 85): cyclePolygonMode() is
	  called but no aa.requestRedraw() afterwards. Is this intended?
	  EventQueue.cpp (rev 1.8): in keyRelease & keyPressed KEY_Alt_R
	  was mapped to MODKEY_LEFT_ALT"

2006-11-03 14:07 +0000 [r5687]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-02 12:27 +0000 [r5679]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-10-30 12:28 +0000 [r5671]  robert:

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix to get the proper normals
	  on an md2 model, actually the way it was before would sometimes
	  lead to a crash since it was attaching the wrong array to the
	  geometry..."

2006-10-30 12:23 +0000 [r5670]  robert:

	* From Vladimir Shabanov, "The DDS plugin didn't correctly read
	  mipmapped A8L8 textures. I've attached a small fix for this.
	  Cause: uncompressed mipmap handling was done only for RGB pixel
	  format. Fix: added condition for handling alpha and luminance
	  formats too."

2006-10-30 12:19 +0000 [r5669]  robert:

	* From Michael Henheffer, "There's a problem with OverlayNodes
	  where the texture will not display if continuous updating is set
	  to false. The problem was being caused by the camera update call
	  never being made if continuous updating was not set to true. This
	  fix adds a flag that is set when dirtyOverlayTexture() is called
	  and checked in the update visitor section of the traversal to
	  determine if the camera should be updated. I tested the fix by
	  making some changes to the osgAnimate example program so it has
	  continuous updating off and calls dirtyOverlayTexture for each
	  frame. The overlay texture now displays properly."

2006-10-30 12:14 +0000 [r5668]  robert:

	* From Edgar Ellis, " method may not take the node into
	  consideration when computing its bound. In this case of:
	  switch->insertChild(0, child, false); switch->insertChild(1,
	  child, true); child will not be used in computeBound, but will be
	  drawn. Solution: Changed compute bound to loop over children
	  using an index instead of an iterator. This behaviour matches
	  that of the traverse method."
	  -----------------------------------------------

2006-10-30 12:05 +0000 [r5667]  robert:

	* From Michael Henheffer, "Bug: The reader would crash when trying
	  to load a .tif image that contained an 8-bit color map. The crash
	  occured at line 545: remap_row(currPtr, inbuf, w, red, green,
	  blue); Cause: The code was trying to write past the end of the
	  buffer while doing this remapping. The size of the buffer is
	  determined based on the value of 'format', which was 1 in this
	  case since bitspersample is 8(indicating a 8-bit color map). The
	  buffer should have been created 3 times as large since that 8-bit
	  value is indexing a 24-bit color. Fix: I've put in an if
	  statement to set format to 3 if 'photometric' indicates the tif
	  contains a palette as the output data will always be 24-bit color
	  data in this case."

2006-10-30 11:55 +0000 [r5666]  robert:

2006-10-21 21:06 +0000 [r5656]  robert:

	* Fixed OSX x86 endian issue in Quicktime movie plugin.

2006-10-17 15:17 +0000 [r5655]  robert:

	* From David Callu: " the main problem is the wrapper generation:
	  The PropertyInfo class use MethodInfo class to access to the
	  value. When the property are define with the I_Property* macro,
	  the MethodInfo use by the property to have access to the value
	  are instancied in the I_Property* macro, but there are already
	  instantied by the I_Method* macro before secondary problem: - the
	  function used by the property could no be customized in the
	  genwrapper.conf file - an array property can't insert a value -
	  the std::map reflector (and indexedProperty in general) haven't
	  remove method - about the help in wrapper ... why not ...
	  solution : To use the function define by the I_Method, I add a
	  MethodInfo variable in the I_Method0 macro old macro : #define
	  I_Method0(ret, fn) (\ params.clear(),\ addMethod(new
	  osgIntrospection::TypedMethodIn fo0<reflected_type, ret
	  >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn, params))) new macro :
	  #define I_Method0(ret, fn, signature, briefHelp, detailedHelp) \
	  params.clear(); \ osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature =
	  addMethod(new osgIntrospection::TypedMethodInfo0<reflected_type,
	  ret >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn, params, briefHelp,
	  detailedHelp)); sink(signature) the osgIntrospection::MethodInfo*
	  signature is used by the I_Property macro to define the
	  MethodInfo that it use so for I_Property macro : old macro :
	  #define I_PropertyWithReturnType(t, n, r) \ cap=addProperty(new
	  osgIntrospection::PropertyInfo(osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(reflected_type)),
	  osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(t)), #n, \
	  I_Method0(t, get##n), \ I_Method1(r, set##n, IN, t, value))) new
	  macro: #define I_SimpleProperty(t, n, get, set) \ get, \ set))
	  The genwrapper has been modified in this way. The method
	  signature is define by the prototype of the method For example,
	  the "const char* libraryName();" have "__C5_char_P1__libraryName"
	  for signature solution for secondary problem: The genwrapper
	  accept new tokens in the configuration to custumize the property.
	  The new PropertyInserter and the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute
	  class has been defined The PropertyRemover has been added to the
	  StdMapReflector The _briefHelp and _detailedHelp variable has
	  been added in PropertyInfo, MethodInfo and ContructorInfo class
	  modification: I have modify the genwrapper files
	  Configuration.cpp Configuration.h add some tokens to custumize
	  the property Doxyfile.template add the comment in the output xml
	  genwrapper.conf customize some property in osg::Geometry

	* From John Aughey, "Attached is the Optimizer.cpp file that has
	  the fix to duplicate vertex and normal arrays if there is more
	  than one reference to the data. This fixes the problem where the

2006-10-03 19:55 +0000 [r5628]  robert:

	* From John Aughey, "The id name of nodes are not being set in the

2006-10-03 09:55 +0000 [r5625]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "This submission adds multitexture support
	  for detecting translucent images used to enable alpha blending.
	  Mesh was syncronized with featureset from Face record."

2006-10-03 09:39 +0000 [r5624]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "I think some nitpicking is required. The
	  loop duration was added in OpenFlight version 15.8. With the
	  attached changes the flasher unit on the spinnercar and the
	  character_anim model from the Creator gallery behaves."

2006-10-02 15:59 +0000 [r5623]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, "I've included render bin checks in the
	  StateSet::compare function, because without them the Optimizer
	  can incorrectly eliminate (otherwise identical) StateSets from
	  different render bins."

2006-10-02 15:38 +0000 [r5622]  robert:

	* Added releaseGLObjects to NodeCallbacks, Drawable::DrawCallbacks
	  and wired up osgProducer to use it when doing cleanup_frame.

2006-10-02 15:09 +0000 [r5621]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, Bug fix for sequence node direction, It examines
	  the number of children in the Group record destructor, so that
	  the total duration of the sequence matches the specified
	  loopDuration field.

2006-10-02 14:11 +0000 [r5620]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "Here is the patch we discussed previously
	  about adding a flag to CullSettings which allows CameraNode to
	  inherit the clear color."

2006-10-02 13:40 +0000 [r5619]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The ColorControl of osg::LightModel is
	  never applied because it incorrectly checks for a valid OpenGL
	  version. Instead of checking if the current version is exactly
	  1.2, it will check if the version is greater than 1.2."

2006-10-02 13:24 +0000 [r5618]  robert:

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix for loading the same file
	  multiple times with the COLLADA plugin. dae->load will not return
	  DAE_OK the second time a model is loaded, so a second check for
	  DAE_ERR_COLLECTION_ALREADY_EXISTS has been added."

2006-10-02 13:11 +0000 [r5617]  robert:

	* From Edgar Ellis, "Changed return type of osg::equivalent methods
	  from float/double to bool. "

2006-10-02 13:07 +0000 [r5616]  robert:

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "Attached is a small bug fix in the DW
	  plugin. The texture application matrix is read into a double
	  matrix called mx, it was declared as 3x2, it's now fixed to 3x3."

2006-10-02 11:47 +0000 [r5615]  robert:

	* Added SERIALIZER to ReaderWriterDAE to make sure initialization
	  is thread safe.

2006-10-02 11:38 +0000 [r5614]  robert:

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "Attached is a modified
	  ReaderWriterDAE.cpp which creates the one and only DAE instance
	  when it's first needed instead of in the constructor. This fixes
	  the problem with osgdb_dae.dll not being loaded due to unwanted
	  ordering of global initialization. This fix and the previous fix
	  of the COLLADA plugin might be unnecessary with the latest
	  COLLADA DOM, but since many of us will probably still use the
	  older version of the DOM, I guess it's better this way. "

2006-10-02 11:34 +0000 [r5613]  robert:

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "It seems my changes to ESRIShape.dsp (to
	  create an osgdb_shp.dll rather than an osgdb_ESRI.dll) were
	  overwritten by later commits to this file. Here are the changes
	  again, made from the latest version of ESRIShape.dsp."

2006-10-02 11:26 +0000 [r5612]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "There was a bug in ParticleSystem where
	  the bounds is not properly flagged as computed when there is only
	  1 particle. Attached is the fix."

2006-10-01 19:19 +0000 [r5611]  robert:

	* From Chris Hanson, "These changes break out the implementation of
	  the fill/wireframe/point, texture, lighting and backface culling
	  settings from the event handling code in StatesetManipulator into
	  public methods. The event handler now calls the public methods.
	  This allows user code to invoke this same functionality from
	  non-keyboard event inputs without clashing with the
	  keyboard-invoked functionality." From Robert Osfield, tweaks to
	  the above to kepp the coding style the same as the rest of the
	  OSG, also made getPolygonMode() const, and updated the wrappers.

2006-10-01 19:09 +0000 [r5610]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "I have added "billboardCenter" as a reader
	  option to use the center of a billboard as the pivot point."

2006-10-01 19:00 +0000 [r5609]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, "I have corrected a byte swapping problem in
	  the new OpenFlight plugin. It was only reading floats & doubles
	  correctly on little endian systems, which require byte swapping,
	  and not on big endian systems which don't require any swapping."

2006-10-01 16:14 +0000 [r5606-5608]  robert:

	* Added GLUT based osgsimpleviewerGLUT example

	* Added Producer based osgsimplerviewerProducer example

	* Added a based SDL viewer - osgsimpleviewerSDL

	* Updated wrappers

	  osgGA::SimpleViewer

	* Added subclassing from osg::Referenced to allow the SimpleViewer
	  to be safely managed on the heap.

2006-09-30 13:41 +0000 [r5595]  robert:

	* Added check to init to prevent crash when no camera manipulator
	  is supplied.

2006-09-29 21:44 +0000 [r5594]  robert:

	* Added false to setWindowRectangle() call as the InputRange is
	  already set correctly.

	* Added preliminary DatabasePager support.

2006-09-25 16:25 +0000 [r5592]  robert:

	* Added bare bones osgGA::SimpleViewer class to help simplify OSG
	  setup when embedding the OSG into existing GUI applications, and
	  for one one a single camera, single window is required.

2006-09-21 15:09 +0000 [r5591]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-09-21 11:26 +0000 [r5590]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, updated to Xcode projects

2006-09-21 10:38 +0000 [r5587]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I made a small modification to the
	  CullVisitor class so that it uses the inheritance mask of
	  CameraNodes with respect to the compute near/far mode."

2006-09-21 10:01 +0000 [r5586]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, added function for querring whether a mode
	  is a texture related mode or not.

2006-09-21 09:50 +0000 [r5585]  robert:

	* From Loic Dachary, renamed _mips to of_mips to prevent compile
	  problem under MIIPS

2006-09-21 09:24 +0000 [r5584]  robert:

	* Rationalized on the number of libs required.

2006-09-21 08:56 +0000 [r5583]  robert:

	* Removed use osg OSG_LIBS, changing to just -losg and -losgDB.

	* Updates for fade text to work properly, but only in perspetive
	  views at present.

2006-09-19 22:57 +0000 [r5577]  robert:

2006-09-18 20:54 +0000 [r5573]  robert:

	* Introduced new osg::View, and osg::RenderInfo classes into the
	  core OSG to help handle scenes with multiple views with elements
	  that need coordinating on a per view basis. Added beginings of
	  new osgText::FadeText class (not functionality yet).

2006-09-15 13:11 +0000 [r5572]  robert:

	* From Per Fahlberg, "I've fixed the dae plugin so it is only using
	  one instance of the DAE. The crashes seen earlier are gone, it is
	  now possible to read multiple .dae files and converting both to
	  and from .dae files."

2006-09-15 10:21 +0000 [r5571]  robert:

	  dumb VisualStudio 6.0 limitations.

2006-09-07 10:41 +0000 [r5543]  robert:

	* From Mike Weiblen, added missing export to fix osgTerrain wrapper
	  linking under VS

2006-09-06 20:11 +0000 [r5542]  robert:

	* Updated osgTerrain wrapper project file with gdal dependencies.

2006-09-06 14:10 +0000 [r5541]  robert:

	* Tweak to NEWS

2006-09-06 13:53 +0000 [r5540]  robert:

	* Made get methods const

2006-09-06 09:46 +0000 [r5539]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "The previous submission didn't handle
	  Objects with transforms. The attached file corrects this. I also
	  removed the multitexture macro for the Object record. Only Face
	  and Mesh records are valid targets."

2006-09-05 20:18 +0000 [r5537]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, updates to Xcode projects

2006-09-05 17:15 +0000 [r5535]  robert:

	* Removed reference to Sony in COLLADA news entry.

2006-09-05 08:46 +0000 [r5528-5529]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, warning fixes for Cygwin.

	* From Brede Johansen, "I have added an optimization to the
	  OpenFlight plugin. By default it ignores the Object records if
	  it's safe to do so. The reader option preserveObject prevents
	  this optimization. I have also removed the flat shading attribute
	  set by the Object record. This flag is only intended for the
	  "Calculate Shading" operation in Creator."

2006-09-04 20:43 +0000 [r5527]  robert:

	* Added support for imagery and DEM's that wrap around the
	  dateline, this required two passes over the copying of imagery
	  and DEM's to the destination graphs, once for the original
	  position, and once for the wrap around 360 degrees on or before.
	  Also fixed the GeospationExtents constructor that was setting the
	  _max to DBL_MIN rather than -DBL_MAX. This bug causesd the y axis
	  to be computed incorrectly.

2006-09-04 13:35 +0000 [r5526]  robert:

	* Missing part of Farshid Laskari's submission relating to
	  CameraNode RenderOrder.

2006-09-04 13:22 +0000 [r5525]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-09-04 13:15 +0000 [r5524]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've made some changes to osg which I
	  think make it easier to control the render order of CameraNode's.
	  Instead of using the built-in orders (PRE_RENDER, POST_RENDER,
	  NESTED_RENDER), you can specify an integer order. Values less
	  than zero are pre rendered in order. Values greater than zero are
	  post rendered in order. And a value of 0 is equivalent to
	  NESTED_RENDER. The changes should be fully backward compatible.
	  Also, I changed the RenderStageList type from a vector to a list
	  because I needed to be able to insert values anywhere in the
	  list. The reason I made these changes was because I wanted to be
	  able to set the render order of a CameraNode at runtime without
	  having to reorder it in the scenegraph." and later in the final
	  submission message (relating to what has been finally been
	  merged) : "I've rethought my implementation and came up with
	  something a little better. The setRenderOrder will continue to
	  take an enum, but will have an optional orderNum parameter which
	  can be both positive and negative. I think this method is more
	  intuitive and flexible."

2006-09-04 12:52 +0000 [r5523]  robert:

	* Cleaned up the texture setup code.

2006-09-04 12:46 +0000 [r5522]  robert:

	* Added osg::TexMat::s/getScaleByTextureRectangleSize feature that
	  allows one to use the osg::TexMat to automatically scale non
	  dimensional tex coordinats to the size of the last texture
	  rectangle applied.

2006-09-04 06:51 +0000 [r5521]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, removed debug message being written to the
	  console.

2006-09-04 06:47 +0000 [r5520]  robert:

	* Removed typedef TypeList from osgintrospection

2006-09-02 14:27 +0000 [r5519]  robert:

	* Added setting of position.w to 1.0 and removed zscale hack.

2006-09-01 13:34 +0000 [r5518]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-09-01 13:22 +0000 [r5517]  robert:

	* From David Callu, add reflection of std::wstring in the
	  DefaultReflector

2006-09-01 12:52 +0000 [r5516]  robert:

	* From David Callu, "bug fix to reflect the wchar_t in Value and
	  Value.cpp I add the toWString() function. in Type and Type.cpp I
	  just add two function to get a map of propertyList and a map of
	  methodList i need this map in my editor a i think it's could be
	  util to put this functionnality in osgIntrospection,

2006-09-01 12:46 +0000 [r5515]  robert:

	* Removed the String inhertiance from osg::Referenced.

2006-08-31 20:55 +0000 [r5513-5514]  robert:

	* Updated Version number for 1.2 release

	* Updated version numbers of the up comming 1.2 release

2006-08-31 20:48 +0000 [r5512]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, "Attached is a change for GLExtensions.cpp that
	  allows OS X to use dlopen/dlsym instead of NS*Symbol* functions
	  for 10.3 or later. The latter is now deprecated. I'm not
	  completely sure how to test the changes. But I compiled these new
	  changes in and ran the osgvertexprogram and osgshaders examples
	  and they seemed to display the same results as before. With
	  respect to the use of dlopen and dlsym, I was uncertain if the
	  usage should look like Sun or FreeBSD (or something else).
	  Apple's man pages discourage the use of RTLD_DEFAULT so I avoided
	  the FreeBSD implementation and copied the Sun implementation. I'm
	  not sure if this is correct/ideal or not."

2006-08-31 20:26 +0000 [r5511]  robert:

	* Updated NEWS for 1.2 release and added COLLADA plugin

2006-08-31 15:47 +0000 [r5510]  robert:

	* From Mike Wittman, changed release build options to reduce binary
	  bloat.

2006-08-30 09:32 +0000 [r5497]  robert:

	* In TextureAtlasVisitor code added catch for textures that have
	  some geometry with texcoords within 0 to 1.0, but others others
	  out of the 0 to 1 range, these textures are automatically
	  rejected from consideration for adding to a texture atlas.

2006-08-29 15:05 +0000 [r5496]  robert:

	* To the TextureAtlasBuilder added detection of instance where a
	  single drawable has multiple textures on the same texture unit
	  inherited down to it from above.

2006-08-29 12:31 +0000 [r5494]  robert:

	* From Roger James, "I have been going through my modified osg
	  files and came across this fix to the Tesselator. From memory it
	  handles a problem with per primitive normal binding. I must have
	  forgotten to submit it."

2006-08-28 15:46 +0000 [r5485]  robert:

	* Futher work on TextureAtlasBuilder/Visitor, now functioning
	  enough to deploy on real models.

2006-08-28 10:49 +0000 [r5483-5484]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

	* Further work on TextureAlasBuilder and TextureAtlasVisitor.

2006-08-26 21:38 +0000 [r5482]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-08-25 08:48 +0000 [r5474]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I was experiencing hard crashes of my
	  application when using PBO's on machines that don't support
	  PBO's. I think osg incorrectly checks if PBO's are supported. I
	  added a new method to the BufferObject::Extensions class which
	  returns if the "GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object" string is supported.
	  This fixes the problem on my end. Machines without PBO support
	  will continue to work and machines with PBO support will still be
	  able to use it."

2006-08-25 08:42 +0000 [r5473]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, updates to Xcode project

2006-08-24 20:16 +0000 [r5471-5472]  robert:

	* From David Guthrie, "I know there are 50,000 changes to osg/Math
	  for OSX a day, but I think it can be simplified quite a bit. The
	  old code includes <cmath> for pre-10.2 and anything using
	  something other than g++ 4 and then uses std::isnan. For the most
	  current version, it leaves out cmath and uses isnan(). std::isnan
	  and cmath work for the current version, so I just made it include
	  cmath if __APPLE__ is defined and removed the ifdef between
	  versions of OS X for isnan related things. This way the code is
	  all the same, and it's not fragile to someone including <cmath>
	  prior to including osg/Math."

	* Simplified swap bytes code to make it more efficient.

2006-08-24 16:33 +0000 [r5470]  robert:

	  polygons.

2006-08-22 13:07 +0000 [r5461]  robert:

	* From Vaclav Bilek, "The purpose of this change is to suppress
	  "re-reading" of osg::ProxyNodes ( in OF external references)
	  after the OF file is loaded. The change do conditional execution
	  of already existing code. I use this for optimized preprocessing
	  of large databases what can not be loaded in one pass because of
	  memory limits."

2006-08-22 12:49 +0000 [r5459-5460]  robert:

	* From Gary Quinn, updated to take account of new bin directory
	  structure.

	  assignment. Solution was to a compareTextureObjects() test to the
	  Texture*::compare(..) method that the
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::StateSetVisitor uses to determine uniqueness.

2006-08-14 11:03 +0000 [r5451]  robert:

	* Ran dos2unix to fix inconsistent line endings

2006-08-14 07:59 +0000 [r5450]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "The gist of this change is, if the OpenFlight
	  version of the parent file is so old that it doesn't support
	  Light Point palettes or Shader palettes, then the parent file is
	  not allowed to override those palettes in the child."

2006-08-13 20:12 +0000 [r5448]  robert:

	* From Daniel Larimer, "Apple updated their developer tools again
	  and broke the __isnanf and __isnand methods... replacing them
	  with a call to isnan(v) seems to work on both Xcode 2.3 and 2.4"

2006-08-10 06:43 +0000 [r5411]  robert:

	* Addd a setNodeMaskOverride(0xffffffff) to cope with models that

2006-07-31 20:56 +0000 [r5372]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, "I've attached fixes to DataSet that should
	  fix the problems that Maya was seeing yesterday. The issue was
	  that the new interpolation code I submitted didn't use the
	  SourceData's georef, it was assuming that the GDALDataSet had a
	  proper geo-ref. I've made the getInterpolatedValue method a
	  member of SourceData and now it uses the georef the SourceData's
	  georef. I also forward declared the GDALRasterBand class in the
	  DataSet header."

2006-07-31 17:31 +0000 [r5371]  robert:

	* Added Matrix*::getRotate()/setRotate(Quat), deprecating

	  conditional calling of invert_4x4 or invert_4x3 depending on the
	  the right hand column of the matrix. Updated wrappers

2006-07-27 16:41 +0000 [r5367]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, "This patch should fix Gert's problem that
	  he posted on osg-users. I downloaded the sample he posted,
	  reproduced the error, and added an additional check to make sure
	  the GDAL window size was valid. Now his example works fine.
	  Changes made against current CVS. "

2006-07-27 15:23 +0000 [r5366]  robert:

	* From David Spilling, "Matrix_implementation.cpp modified as
	  requested. I ran a version of it through a local version of
	  osgunittests.cpp and it passes. Note that firstly it always
	  returns the positive real quaternion (positive w) Note also that
	  it will sometimes slightly differ from the results of the other
	  methods because it assumes that the input matrix really is a
	  rotation matrix - if it isn't, e.g. because of rounding error,
	  then the output quaternion will be very slightly different. For
	  example, the test matrix 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.999999 0 0 0 0 1
	  will return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0005033 0.0005033 whereas the
	  previous methods return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0 0.0 However, since
	  quaternions are rotations, the meaning of how to convert a matrix
	  that isn't a rotation is a little unclear..."

2006-07-27 12:32 +0000 [r5365]  robert:

	* From Michael Polak, double click fixes/additions

2006-07-27 11:58 +0000 [r5364]  robert:

	  read on different coloured backgrounds

2006-07-27 11:25 +0000 [r5361-5363]  robert:

	* Remove ERSIShape directory.

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "The ESRIShape plugin needs to produce a
	  osgdb_shp.dll rather than a osgdb_ESRI.dll in Windows in order to
	  find the correct library when loading shp files. A new dsp file
	  is attached to this mail. Also, the ERSIShape folder should be
	  deleted."

	* Added #define snprintf _snprintf for Win32 build

2006-07-27 11:14 +0000 [r5359-5360]  robert:

	  removed semi-colon from end of namespace.

2006-07-12 09:40 +0000 [r5281]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "I found some artifacts on some models and
	  traced it back to the external palette override feature. There
	  are some changes in the layout of the external record the loader
	  have to take into consideration. The other fix is to remove the
	  OF pools from the user data of the external ProxyNode when it is
	  no longer needed."

2006-07-11 21:53 +0000 [r5280]  robert:

	* Removed StateSet::ENCLOSE_RENDERBIN_DETAILS since it is

2006-07-11 14:24 +0000 [r5279]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "Here's a small patch to
	  BlendFunc::setFunction(source,destination) to make it consistent
	  with the constructor and prevent the BlendFuncSeparate path being
	  called. This patch fixed the artifact with the osgpointsprite
	  demo on ATI cards reported by Mike Weiblen."

2006-07-11 10:34 +0000 [r5277-5278]  robert:

	* From Antoine Hue, "There was a typo in "int setNotifyOffset()",
	  appear to be a getter => "int getNotifyOffset()". Then I have
	  added a switch to create GDALTermProgress only when the current
	  notify level + local offset permit message display. In fact, if
	  the offset is set to 0 and the notify level is at the default,
	  DataSet is quiet but for the GDALTermProgress. That is quite
	  disturbing since you think the progress is related to the
	  complete processing but it is actually only related to the GDAL
	  Warp."

	* Added preciption effects to NEWS

2006-07-11 09:06 +0000 [r5276]  robert:

	* Updated NEWS and ChangeLog

2006-07-06 14:14 +0000 [r5267]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "If a texture is used that is not a
	  multiple of four, and compression was requested through the
	  texture's internal format, the texture's internal format reverts
	  to a non-compressed type and a NOTICE is given. At present,
	  compressed textures must have a multiple of four in each
	  dimension."

2006-07-06 14:10 +0000 [r5266]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2006-07-06 14:02 +0000 [r5265]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "Attached is some fixes for
	  Image::readImageFromCurrentTexture. It was failing when used with
	  a new Image object (some of the fields were not set before they
	  were used, and some were set to the wrong values). A new optional
	  parameter was added to give the desired data type, which defaults
	  to GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, so programs should only need a recompile to
	  work properly."

2006-07-06 13:06 +0000 [r5264]  robert:

	* Updated version numbers for 1.1 release

	* Tweaked polygon offset

2006-07-06 09:11 +0000 [r5256]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, updaetes to Xcode projects

2006-07-06 08:36 +0000 [r5255]  robert:

	* From Vivek Rajan, "Rotated text in SCREEN_COORDS was looking a
	  little squished especially in orthographic projection. Performing
	  the rotation before the scaling fixed the problem. I've attached
	  Text.cpp with the fix." From Robert Osfield, in keeping with
	  Vivek's change moved the auto rotate to screen befor the scale as
	  well.

2006-07-05 21:52 +0000 [r5254]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "The attached Texture.cpp fixes a problem
	  when subloading compressed textures. Near the top of the function
	  that implements texture subloading,
	  osg::Texture::applyTexImage2D_subload(), the local variable
	  compressed_image examines the _image's_ pixel format to see if it
	  is compressed. However, further on, in calls to
	  getCompressedSize() the _texture's_ pixel format is used. In my
	  application's Texture2D class, I use
	  osg::Texture::USE_ARB_COMPRESSION to
	  osg::Texture2D::setInternalFormatMode(), which causes the
	  internal format to become one of the generic ARB_COMPRESSED
	  types, which do not have a specific size. Thus the recent warning
	  message added to osg::Texture::getCompressedSize() is triggered.
	  The correct behavior is to use the format mode from the Image
	  class instead of the Texture class within the subload
	  implementation, and then the size is calculated correctly."

2006-07-05 21:12 +0000 [r5252-5253]  robert:

	* Updated AUTHORS file

	* Fixed typo.

2006-07-05 20:56 +0000 [r5251]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "Changed ">" to ">=" when testing for
	  version 16.1 or later."

2006-07-05 13:44 +0000 [r5250]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "There is code in Image.cpp that calculates
	  the size of a compressed image based on the internal format.
	  There is similar code in the Texture class but it does not
	  account for the ARB types. I modified the Texture class
	  implementation to show a warning when an incomplete internal
	  format is used to calculate the image size."

2006-07-05 13:31 +0000 [r5249]  robert:

	* Added mutex to the test context.

2006-07-05 13:18 +0000 [r5248]  robert:

	* Added vertex program hack to get round apparent NVidia bug when
	  handling vertex texture read.

2006-07-05 08:59 +0000 [r5239]  robert:

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, "Mingws gcc includes a file called
	  types.h which in turn defines _TYPES_H_. types.h in the directx
	  plugin defines the same include guard. I've renamed the guard
	  name in this file to _DX_TYPES_H_. Now the plugin compile in
	  mingw too."

2006-07-05 08:55 +0000 [r5238]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, renaned FLT_preserveFace to preserveFace

2006-07-04 19:58 +0000 [r5237]  robert:

	* Changed parameter name from osberver_ptr to observer.

2006-07-04 19:54 +0000 [r5236]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Previously, the new OpenFlight plugin only
	  allowed ext ref models to use their own palettes. With this
	  change, parent models can override child model palettes with the
	  parent palettes. These changes are made against very current CVS
	  (just updated about 1/2 hour ago, eliminated conflicts, and
	  retested before this posting). To regurgitate what I did: A new
	  class, ParentPools (public osg::Referenced), is created when an
	  ext ref record is parsed, and it is populated with any parent
	  model pools that should override the child model pools (according
	  to bits in the ext ref record). The ParentPools object is then
	  set as UserData on the ProxyNode corresponding to the ext ref.
	  When the ReadExternalsVisitor hits the ProxyNode, it takes its
	  UserData and sets it as UserData in the Options parameter to the
	  osgDB::ReadNode call, which then read the ext ref model. In the
	  course of parsing the Options string, ReaderWriterFLT also looks
	  at the Options UserData and sets the parent pools in the Document
	  class accordingly. When palette records are encountered while
	  loading a file, they are ignored if the corresponding pool was
	  set by the parent. Thanks to Brede for consulting with me on the
	  implementation. "

2006-07-04 14:37 +0000 [r5235]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-07-04 14:18 +0000 [r5234]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find some modifications to
	  Producer, osgGA and osgProducer to enable Mac OS X support for +
	  scrollwheels, + mightymouse-srollballs + new tracking-pads with
	  scroll feature + tablet-support (pressure, proximity and
	  pointertype) (Wacom only tested) I think there was a bug in the
	  windows-implementation of scroll-wheel support (wrong order of
	  ScrollingMotion-enum, casting problem) which is fixed now. The
	  scrollwheel-code is a bit klunky across platforms, some devices
	  on OS X can report an absolute delta in pixel-coordinates not
	  only the direction, so for now there is scrollingMotion (which
	  describes the direction) and scrolldeltax and scrolldeltay. I
	  decided to leave the scrollingmotion-stuff to not break old code
	  relying on this."

2006-07-04 13:56 +0000 [r5232-5233]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

	* Change osgText so that the Text drawable now can have its own
	  StateSet that users can assign to it without it being overriden.
	  If none is assigned externally it now uses a StateSet associated
	  wit the Font assigned to the Text.

2006-07-04 13:33 +0000 [r5231]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "The attached file corrects two small typos
	  in MultiSwitch.cpp. The local "values" reference and the
	  "_values" member attribute are of different types but both are
	  vectors so the size() operator happily compiles. A renaming of
	  _values to _masks or similar may be a more future proof solution
	  but the submission only removes the underscore in two places. The
	  switch_1701.flt model part of the Creator gallery revealed this
	  bug."

2006-07-04 12:57 +0000 [r5230]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowski, "Added the ability to read and write images
	  directly in the ive plugin, through the osgDB::readImageFile and
	  osgDB::writeImageFile functions. This is useful for storing
	  compressed textures on disk for rapid playback for animations."

	* From Michael Platings, added support for blend seperates to .ive

2006-06-27 10:07 +0000 [r5188]  robert:

	* From Terrex and Andrew Sampsom and Don Tidrow and Robert Osfield,
	  email comments from Andew Sampson, "I've contacted Terrex, and
	  obtained the 2.2 version of their trpage library. The library
	  included a fork of OSG 0.9.8's txp plugin, modified to load 2.1+
	  txp DBs. I've done the work of incorporating the changes made to
	  OSG's txp plugin since 0.9.8 into Terrex's fork. The forked
	  version is now up-to-date with the changes made to OSG 0.9.9 and
	  1.0. Terrex made a lot of changes (especially differences in
	  whitespace), so the diff between the forked version and OSG 1.0's
	  txp plugin is yucky. I did my best, but keep in mind that this is
	  the result of a 4-way merge (kinda... terrex-0.9.8, stock-0.9.8,
	  stock-0.9.9, stock-1.0). I really want to see this forked version
	  merged back into the main OSG branch. The new features offered by
	  this version of the plugin (2.1+ support, variable LOD support,
	  bug fixes) are worth the trouble." -- Don Tidrow then took this
	  code and added his work. -- Robert Osfield then fixed all the
	  warnings that abound in the trpage code base.

2006-06-26 20:45 +0000 [r5185-5187]  robert:

	* Replaced ref_ptr<>:take with ref_ptr<>:release, and added
	  handling of removeal of ref_ptr<> operator >.

	* Added DeleteHandler flush call.

	  associated functions. From Robert Osfield, tweaks and fixes to
	  the above, also removed the deprecated take() method.

	* From Leandro Motta Barros, documentation additions to
	  PrimitiveSet & TriangleFunctor.

2006-06-26 09:30 +0000 [r5179]  robert:

	* From Philipp Siemoleit, There are some group codes (i.e. "62")
	  which are interpreted as dxfDataType::SHORT. That's right because
	  the dxf-specification defines "16 bit integer" as the type for
	  the corresponding value. But readerBase::readGroup() calls
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short). I changed
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) to
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, short). I found no group code at the
	  dxf-specs which needs a "16 bit unsigned integer" value. So the
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) function is obsolete -
	  right?

2006-06-26 09:18 +0000 [r5178]  robert:

	* From David Fries, Reset only the RenderLeaf objects used in the
	  last frame as given by the _currentReuseRenderLeafIndex instead

	  Brede and I have submitted changes to this plugin that aren't in
	  current CVS yet -- this change is based on current CVS, not our
	  changed files.) This changes how shader palette records are
	  parsed to support GLSL per the OpenFlight 16.1 spec. Existing
	  functionality for 16.0 files is preserved. The change to

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The drawInner() method of
	  osgUtil::RenderStage ignores the checkForGLErrors flag of the
	  osg::State object. The attatched file fixes this."

	  called removeChildren(uint, uint) which is now the only virtual
	  method. There removeChildren is now the method to override in

2006-03-17 22:25 +0000 [r5054-5056]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

	* Added exports.

	* From Keith Steffen, changed instance of sun to sun_geode to avoid
	  Solaris10 build issue with it defining "sun"?#!

2006-03-17 14:05 +0000 [r5053]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, Added ability to read/write the texture
	  tile settings of osgParticle::Particle to .osg files.

2006-03-17 11:28 +0000 [r5052]  robert:

	* From Sohey Yamamoto, fixed eroneous CHECK_BLACK_LISTED_MODES enum
	  value, changing 0xA0 to 0x100

2006-03-15 15:49 +0000 [r5051]  robert:

	* Added createEvent() convinience method.

2006-03-15 12:26 +0000 [r5049-5050]  robert:

	* Added comment on the meaning of the matrix paramter in the
	  computeIntersections methods.

	* Added moving sphere segment intersections.

2006-03-15 11:21 +0000 [r5048]  robert:

	* From Martin Naylor, build fix for Win32.

2006-03-15 10:36 +0000 [r5047]  robert:

	* From Martin Naylor, added ESRIShape.dsp project

2006-03-14 13:18 +0000 [r5046]  robert:

	* Build fixes

2006-03-14 09:33 +0000 [r5045]  robert:

	* Added 21 as the version number of xine video plugin to allow it
	  work with latest versions of xine.

2006-03-14 09:23 +0000 [r5044]  robert:

	* From Martin Naylor, added normals VS project

2006-03-13 21:29 +0000 [r5043]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The following patch adds a multisample
	  option to the osg::DisplaySettings class. OsgCameraGroup will now
	  read the setting from the DisplaySettings instead of hardcoding
	  the value. I added the following commandline option to be able to
	  set the multisample value: --samples <num> One thing to note,
	  OsgCameraGroup would previously check if the computer is an SGI
	  and set multisample to 4. I retained this check in
	  DisplaySettings to be backwards compatible."

2006-03-13 21:20 +0000 [r5042]  robert:

	* From Andrew Sampson, "The terravista terrain generation tool can
	  insert references to external model files into a terrapage tile.
	  It unfortunately does not update the bounding sphere of that tile
	  to include the extents of the external model. This means that if
	  a large model (such as an airfield model) is attached to a tile,
	  the model will disappear when the tile is off-screen (outside the
	  view volume), even though the model is on-screen."

2006-03-13 13:19 +0000 [r5041]  robert:

	* Added an EventQueue directly into osgProducer::Viewer.

2006-03-09 15:16 +0000 [r5040]  robert:

	* Checked in the genwrapper generated Export.cpp. This does seem to
	  be an eroneously built file though since Export.cpp doesn't
	  appear in the other plugins... I have checked it in here to keep
	  the builds running, there isn't actually any useful body in the
	  Export.cpp.

2006-03-09 13:02 +0000 [r5039]  robert:

	* Ran dos2unix on new OpenFlight files.

2006-03-08 21:38 +0000 [r5038]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, new OpenFlight plugin!!!!! By default the
	  original flt plugin is still used, to select at runtime the new
	  plugin set the env OSG_OPEN_FLIGHT_PLUGIN=new

2006-03-08 16:11 +0000 [r5037]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, added osg::getGlVersion() and fixed a minor typo
	  in Texture3D.

2006-03-08 15:40 +0000 [r5036]  robert:

	* Added EventQueue.

2006-03-08 15:30 +0000 [r5035]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "A while back the behaviour of extension
	  alias' was modified so that the user can override existing
	  alias'. The change allowed for circular references, so the
	  createLibraryNameForExtension would get caught in an endless
	  loop. The following fix will catch circular references."

2006-03-08 15:26 +0000 [r5034]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed that sometimes when a particle
	  emitter is re-enabled, a few particles will appear at the
	  location it was disabled at. The problem is that the previous
	  local to world matrix is not being updated while it is disabled.
	  I modified the particle processor so that it will set the dirty
	  flag for the previous local to world matrix when the processor is
	  skipped for a frame, since the value will no longer be relevant."

2006-03-08 15:16 +0000 [r5033]  robert:

	* From Roger James, "1. Fixed a problem with the caching of
	  textures when the associated image file was not in the current
	  working directory. In this case the texture object was being
	  placed in the cache with the short filename, but was looked up
	  with the full path. 2. Fixed a problem with the caching of
	  textures when CACHE_IMAGES was enabled. This caused a conflict is
	  the names used to cache the image and texture objects. 3. Fixed a
	  problem where AC3D generates surfaces with duplicate vertex
	  indices. 4. Removed what I believe are redundant calls to the
	  tesselator. 5. Added a couple of asserts which should fire in
	  debug mode if my assumptions about 4. are incorrect. 6. Removed
	  obviously unused code. (Stuff that was commented or ifdeffed
	  out.)" Note, from Robert Osfield, changed the asserts to if ()
	  report error using notify so we can catch errors in both
	  optimized and debug builds, but without crashing.

2006-03-08 14:09 +0000 [r5032]  robert:

	* Converted osgGA::GUIEventAdapter into a concrete class capable of
	  respresenting keyboard and mouse events. Added osgGA::EventQueue
	  class to support a thread safe event queue and adaption of
	  keyboard and mouse events. Removed osgProducer::EventAdapter as
	  GUIEventAdapter replaces it. Adapted osgProducer and examples to
	  work with the new changes to osgGA.

2006-03-07 18:26 +0000 [r5031]  don:

	* Improved the GET protocol for the http socket. By adding
	  Connection: close the server sends a EOF immediately after the
	  data, improving performance because readers are not left waiting
	  for EOF.

2006-03-05 20:46 +0000 [r5030]  robert:

	* Began work on making EventVisitor capable of adapting events
	  directly.

2006-03-02 20:39 +0000 [r5029]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, support for writing to istream for the the
	  TIFF plugin and support for controlling PNG compression level via
	  the the ReaderWriter::Option string "PNG_COMPRESSION <level>"

2006-03-02 20:31 +0000 [r5028]  robert:

	* Added automatic toggling between png and jpeg when
	  compressImageData option is used. Jpeg is used to compress RGB
	  data only, the just of the formats are passed on to the png
	  plugin.

2006-03-02 15:26 +0000 [r5027]  robert:

	* From Robert Swain, compile fix for debian unstable.

2006-03-02 14:58 +0000 [r5025]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashakari, support for png write.

2006-03-01 10:17 +0000 [r5024]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached another modified version of
	  the IVE loader which supports compressing the image data. The
	  option to compress the data is "compressImageData". Currently it
	  uses the jpeg plugin to write the image. Maybe we could add an
	  option that allows the user to specify which image format to use.
	  The jpeg writer supports specifying the quality of the jpeg, so
	  you could use the following command line to convert the
	  skydome.osg model to IVE using 50% jpeg quality: osgconv -O
	  "compressImageData JPEG_QUALITY 50" skydome.osg skydome.ive"

2006-02-28 21:18 +0000 [r5023]  robert:

	* Added TextureRectangle.cpp

2006-02-28 20:10 +0000 [r5022]  robert:

	* Compile fix.

2006-02-28 19:46 +0000 [r5021]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, added missing array handling into
	  Geometry::accept(AttributeFunctor& af) and
	  Geometry::accept(ConstAttributeFunctor& af).

2006-02-28 19:36 +0000 [r5020]  robert:

	* Further clean up of RefNodePath references.

2006-02-28 19:12 +0000 [r5019]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-02-28 18:54 +0000 [r5018]  robert:

	* Fixes to removed dependency on RefNodePath.

2006-02-27 19:51 +0000 [r5015-5017]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

	* Ported NodeTrackCallback and NodeTrackManipulator across to use
	  oberserver_ptr instead of RefNodePath. Removed now redundent
	  RefNodePath.

	* Added support in osg::computeWorldToLocal and compteLocalToWorld
	  functions for automatically stripping any absolute or root
	  CameraNode's from the NodePaths. Added
	  osg::Node::getWorldMatrices() convinience method.

2006-02-27 19:44 +0000 [r5014]  robert:

	* Added new observer_ptr templated smart pointer to allow one to
	  retain pointers to objects but have the pointer reset to null if
	  that object is deleted.

2006-02-26 17:45 +0000 [r5013]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've made some changes to the IVE loader
	  which will add the capability of saving image files inside the
	  IVE file. Currently, only the raw image data is saved into the
	  file. If your model uses jpg images as textures then this will
	  cause your file size to increase. I've added an option that will
	  embed the original image file into the IVE file. The IVE file
	  will then attempt to read the image from memory. Since most image
	  loaders support reading from memory, this shouldn't be a problem.
	  To use this new feature the user must specify the option
	  "includeImageFileInIVEFile" when converting to IVE. I tested this
	  out on the "skydome.osg" model that comes with OSG. Using the old
	  method, the IVE file size would be 785 KB, with the new method it
	  is only 42 KB. Also, I've added the support for
	  TextureRectangle's to the IVE reader/writer."

2006-02-24 13:57 +0000 [r5011-5012]  robert:

	* Added debugging code to help pick out instablilities in
	  osgParticle. Debugging code now commented out.

	* Added clamping of the wind force contribution to acceletion of
	  particle so that the de-acceleration never exceed the actual wind
	  vector itself.

2006-02-23 20:37 +0000 [r5010]  robert:

	* Completed .osg support for ClusterCullingCallback.

2006-02-23 16:47 +0000 [r5009]  robert:

	* Disabled the running of tristripping and smoothing from within
	  the Simplifier.

2006-02-23 12:41 +0000 [r5007-5008]  robert:

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, spelling fixes.

	* Fixed function name call.

2006-02-22 20:51 +0000 [r5006]  robert:

	* Fixed getBound() comment.

2006-02-22 19:28 +0000 [r5005]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-02-22 19:14 +0000 [r5004]  robert:

	* Fixed typo of Validity.

2006-02-22 16:05 +0000 [r5003]  robert:

	* From Thom Carlo, with tweak from Robert Osfield, removed the
	  setting of the outline colour (the emission part of material)
	  during setup of the Carton effects for the second pass.

2006-02-22 14:35 +0000 [r5002]  robert:

	* Fixed documentation.

2006-02-22 14:31 +0000 [r5001]  robert:

	* Added support for OpenGL mode black listing to provide better
	  support for extension checking and invalidation of OpenGL modes
	  associated with extensions.

2006-02-21 21:29 +0000 [r4999-5000]  robert:

	* Added ClusterCullingCallback.cpp

	* Added initial cut of ClusterCullingCallback .osg support.

2006-02-21 14:34 +0000 [r4998]  robert:

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, spelling fixes.

2006-02-21 13:55 +0000 [r4997]  robert:

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, VS2005 Syntax highling regonition.

2006-02-21 13:51 +0000 [r4996]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "I've attempted to make AutoTransform override
	  computeBounds() to return an invalid bounding sphere if it hasn't
	  seen a cull traversal yet. It depends on _firstTimeToSetEyePoint,
	  which is initially true, then false after a cull. There might be
	  a better way? If so, let me know. This change does resolve the
	  issue I had encountered with auto scale to screen and incorrect
	  culling."

2006-02-21 12:39 +0000 [r4995]  robert:

	* From Trajce Nikolov, "small fix for the flt loader - the back
	  color of the bidirectional light points"

2006-02-20 21:05 +0000 [r4994]  robert:

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, spelling corrections and a few Doxgen
	  comments.

2006-02-20 20:06 +0000 [r4993]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "There was a problem with the PNG plugin
	  when it encounters an image that is less than 8 bits per pixel
	  (this can happen with greyscale or paletted images). It was a
	  pretty simple problem to fix."

2006-02-20 19:13 +0000 [r4992]  robert:

	* From Nathan Monteleone, addition of AutoTransform support.

2006-02-20 16:50 +0000 [r4991]  robert:

	* Moved the intialization variable reset to end of the init
	  funciton to avoid multi-thread initialization from producing
	  different results.

2006-02-20 16:20 +0000 [r4990]  robert:

	* From Ed Ralston, "According to the OSX Developer Documentation,
	  CFRelease cannot be called with a NULL argument. This patch
	  prevents osgDB::FileUtils from doing this."

2006-02-20 15:46 +0000 [r4989]  robert:

	* Added missing swap byte operations to readVec*sArray() methods.

2006-02-20 15:32 +0000 [r4988]  robert:

	* From Daniel Larimer, fixed error is swap byte code handling
	  vector<short>

2006-02-20 15:25 +0000 [r4987]  robert:

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, "when building debug libs in mingw the
	  .dll.a files are not copied to the lib/MINGW(32) folder. The
	  makefiles in the attached zip should fix this."

2006-02-09 19:31 +0000 [r4986]  don:

	* Fixed a bug spotted in UFOManipulator where a Vec3's 4th
	  component was being inspected (ip[3]).

2006-02-09 12:20 +0000 [r4985]  robert:

	* Added BlenColour(Vec4) constructor and updated wrappers.

2006-02-08 23:41 +0000 [r4984]  don:

	* Added a filter to the Delaunay Triangulator to insure that
	  incoming points are unique in the X and Y components.

2006-02-06 20:36 +0000 [r4983]  robert:

	* Added s/getDoTriStrip and s/getSmoothing method.

2006-02-06 19:41 +0000 [r4981-4982]  don:

	* Added normals and ESRIshape directories to makedirdefs

	* Added 'normals' pseudoloader

	* Improved default settings, re-enambled smoothing and tri
	  stripping of sampled data.

2006-02-06 17:12 +0000 [r4979]  robert:

	* Added support for up sampling by dividing longest edges.

2006-02-05 21:53 +0000 [r4978]  robert:

	* From David Guthrie, OSX marco reworking to better handling
	  different OSX versions.

2006-02-04 21:25 +0000 [r4977]  robert:

	* From Edmond Gheury, fixe and bug in the PrimitiveShapeVisitor.

2006-02-04 21:20 +0000 [r4976]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, " I've modified in order to make FBO mipmapping
	  work. In FrameBufferObject.cpp there is also another fix: when
	  initializing a FBO attachment from a CameraNode attachment, the
	  renderbuffer's format must be set to the attachment's internal
	  format, not to the image's pixel format. Another problem is that
	  attaching a renderbuffer to the FBO through CameraNode is not
	  simple (if not impossible) if you don't intend to specify an
	  Image object. Probably CameraNode could be enriched with an
	  "attach(buffer, width, height, format)" method. For example if
	  you attach a color buffer as a texture whose size is different
	  than that of the CameraNode's viewport you also need to attach a
	  depth buffer of the same size, because the depth buffer that is
	  automatically attached by RenderStage has the viewport's size.
	  FBOs require that all attachment have the same dimensions, so
	  said setup will fail if you can't specify a custom depth
	  renderbuffer"

2006-02-04 21:12 +0000 [r4975]  robert:

	* From Brad Anderegg, add _frameNumber and associated code to
	  ensure that particles only get updated once per frame.

2006-02-04 21:06 +0000 [r4974]  robert:

	* From Chris Hanson, added get methods for size of file request and
	  data to compile lists.

2006-01-24 17:43 +0000 [r4972]  don:

	* Changes to zip and tgz plug-ins to allow for use of TEMP variable
	  on Windows. Submitted by Zach Deedler

2006-01-24 12:02 +0000 [r4971]  robert:

	* cleaned up clampNearNar code.

2006-01-23 20:38 +0000 [r4970]  robert:

	* Improved the env var reporting to avoid the overlong lines.

2006-01-23 20:16 +0000 [r4969]  robert:

2006-01-21 13:02 +0000 [r4968]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-01-18 12:16 +0000 [r4966-4967]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, adding osgDB::findDataFile() usage.

	* From Marco Jez: here is a patch that enables a new option named
	  "BIND_TEXTURE_MAP" in the LWO plugin. Its purpose is to allow
	  explicit binding between texture UV maps defined in the LWO file
	  and OpenGL texture units, overriding the default mechanism that
	  allocates texture units automatically. This is useful when you
	  have an UV map built in Lightwave (for example an atlas map) but
	  no textures actually using it, so you can keep the UV map (that
	  would be discarded otherwise) and add a texture later int your
	  program. Syntax is: BIND_TEXTURE_MAP <map_name> <texunit>

2006-01-18 12:03 +0000 [r4965]  robert:

	* From Maya Leonard, ERSIShape VS project file, and compile fixes
	  for Win32.

2006-01-18 11:45 +0000 [r4964]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, addition of glw extension checking under Windows,
	  and tweaks to BlendEquation and RenderStage to correct the
	  extensions being tested.

	* From Zbigniew Sroczynski, fix for handling of paths with spaces.

2006-01-17 15:18 +0000 [r4959-4960]  robert:

	* Added new BoxPlacer files.

	* From Zach Deedler, addition of osgParticle/BoxSpacer.

2006-01-16 17:05 +0000 [r4957-4958]  robert:

	* Improved handling of clean up of osg::Program/osg::Shader on
	  closing of a graphis context.

	* Fixed indenting.

2006-01-12 22:43 +0000 [r4956]  robert:

	* Added support for tracking mouse movement and computing the
	  intersection of the mouse position into texture coords.

2006-01-03 16:52 +0000 [r4955]  robert:

	* Added ability to write out the selected parts of the scene graph.

2006-01-03 10:44 +0000 [r4954]  robert:

	* Moved the body of the FBOExtensions::instance() to the .cpp and
	  added bool to control whether that an FBOExtensions structure can
	  be created if missing.

2006-01-02 12:03 +0000 [r4953]  robert:

	* Standardised compile code to use
	  _maximumNumOfObjectsToCompilePerFrame.

2005-12-23 10:59 +0000 [r4951-4952]  robert:

	* Ported picking across to using PickVisitor.

	* Added setting of the parent path on the new PickVisitor.

2005-12-22 14:06 +0000 [r4950]  robert:

	* Seperated out the view and model matrices in IntersectVisitor to
	  allow handling of world coordinates better when using
	  PickVisitor.

2005-12-21 10:32 +0000 [r4949]  robert:

	* Added support for an externally referenced shader file, via the
	  keyword combinations file "shader.vert" OR file shader.vert.

2005-12-20 09:29 +0000 [r4948]  robert:

	* Removed "if (mapExt!=toExt)" from alias map assignement to allow
	  aliases to be overriden for all cases.

2005-12-20 09:13 +0000 [r4947]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, compile fix

2005-12-19 15:05 +0000 [r4946]  robert:

	* Added check against the validity of the _inverse matrix pointer.

2005-12-19 14:48 +0000 [r4945]  robert:

	* From Ali Botorabi, adding of osg::Depth support in .ive format.

2005-12-19 13:57 +0000 [r4944]  robert:

	* Added debugging info for future reference (currently commented
	  out.)

2005-12-19 13:40 +0000 [r4943]  robert:

	* Added transform of the eye point into local coordinates to
	  properly account for transforms within the scene graph.

2005-12-19 12:00 +0000 [r4942]  robert:

	* Fixed computeWindowMatrix so that it properly accounts for x,y
	  position of the viewport.

2005-12-19 11:18 +0000 [r4941]  robert:

	* From Eric Wing, made getLineCount() const.

2005-12-18 16:06 +0000 [r4940]  robert:

	* Improved handling of clamping of projection matrix for scenes
	  with close to zero depth range.

2005-12-16 17:01 +0000 [r4939]  robert:

	* Fixed null matrix op.

2005-12-16 16:27 +0000 [r4938]  robert:

	* Fixed handling of absolute transforms in IntersectVisitor.

2005-11-18 17:04 +0000 [r4811]  robert:

	* Added the ability for osgParticle::ParticleEffect to switch off
	  the automatic setup. Normally the automatic setup is useful, but
	  in the case of the .osg support this automatic update was forcing
	  premature loading of imagery that wasn't necessarily, and can
	  lead to reports of looking for files that arn't present.

2005-11-18 15:00 +0000 [r4810]  robert:

	* The OpenFlight plugin was crashing with pre 15.6 .flt files that
	  contained light points. This was due to the mismatch is size and
	  fiels in the LightPointRecord before 15.6 and after it, the OSG's
	  flt plugin was assuming just 15.6 record structure. As a
	  temporary solution I have disabled the processing of light point
	  records on .flt file version before 15.6, this allows these files
	  to be loaded safely, but without light points.

2005-11-18 10:03 +0000 [r4807]  robert:

	* From Andrew Reyonolds : changed the endian conversion code to
	  work on a temporary rather then on a flt structure to prevent
	  repeated conversion of the same value, something that led to
	  eroneously large light point string sizes.

2005-11-18 09:52 +0000 [r4806]  robert:

	* From Rodger James, changed the Win32 static library compilation

	* Convert tabs to spaces.

2005-11-17 15:18 +0000 [r4802]  robert:

	* From Toshiyuki Takahei, added #pragam to avoid build problem with
	  special characters. From Robert Osfield, added #if _MSC_VER to
	  restrict pragma usage to just VisualStudio, and added comment
	  explaining all the extra parsing code in osgversion.

2005-11-17 15:03 +0000 [r4801]  robert:

	* Replaced tabs with spaces.

2005-11-17 13:35 +0000 [r4800]  robert:

	* From Mike Weiblen, "fix for another one of those GLSL syntax
	  errors that slip thru the nvidia compiler. gl_TexCoord[] is an
	  array of vec4, and must be reduced to a vec2 for use with
	  texture2D()"

2005-11-17 11:13 +0000 [r4797]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolosky, for Cygwin and Minw sections changed

	  GUIEventAdapter::KEY_Space, fix to url in
	  Matrix_implementation.cpp. Syntax fixes by Robert Osfield to
	  above submission fix inconsistencies with normal OSG coding

	* Change the KeySwitchMatrixManipulator so that it two sets of
	  getMatrixManipulator methods, two that takes an index,two that
	  takes a key value. Updated the ViewEventHandler so the it now
	  uses the getMatrixManipulatorWithIndex() method to avoid previous
	  ambiguity.

2005-11-14 09:31 +0000 [r4754]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari : "I reported earlier about a problem with
	  a custom emitter I was using. I spent some more time debugging
	  and it turns out there was a bug in the
	  ParticleSystem::update_bounds function. When the bound is being
	  reset, both the min and max are being set to the same postion
	  without the radius being subtracted/added to it. When there is
	  only one particle alive in the system this causes it to be culled
	  by small feature culling. I've modifed the function so that when
	  the bound is reset, the radius is subtracted/added to the
	  position. This fixes my problem."

	* Updated wrappers.

	* Added the support in AnimationPathCallback for taking a pivot,
	  axis and rotation rate paramters in its constructor to allow it
	  to be used to create rotations around a point. This provides the
	  same interface and functionality as osgUtil::TransformCallback
	  but has the advantage and AnimationPathCallback is fully
	  supported by the .osg and .ive file formats.

2005-11-09 13:39 +0000 [r4711-4712]  robert:

	* Updated the runexamples.bat to include glsl_mandelbrot.osg and

	* From Brad Colbert/Robert Osfield: added s/getSourceFormat and
	  s/getSourceType to osg::Texture along with support for this
	  Texture1D, 2D, 3D, TextureCubeMap and TextureRectangle. The new
	  SourceFormat and SourceType parameters are only used when no
	  osg::Image is assigned to an osg::Texture, and main use is for
	  render to texture effects. Added support for --hdr option in
	  osgprerender, which utilises the new
	  Texture::setSourceFormat/Type() methods.

2005-11-08 14:03 +0000 [r4699]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2005-11-08 13:51 +0000 [r4698]  robert:

	  opening files for writing in the .ive plugin.

2005-11-08 11:46 +0000 [r4697]  robert:

	* Added sorting and clearing of pre and post RenderStages stored in
	  RenderStage, and added some debugging comments which are
	  currently commented out from compilation - these are left in just
	  in case future debug work requires them.

2005-11-08 09:36 +0000 [r4696]  robert:

	* Changed the occluder traversal so that checks the children of the
	  SceneView's Cameara rather than starting at the camera itself.

2005-11-07 16:52 +0000 [r4695]  robert:

	  matrices contained NaN's.

2005-11-07 15:46 +0000 [r4692-4693]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, proper c++ cast instead of c-cast for
	  ApplicationUsage

	* From Steve Lunsford, added psuedo event dispatch to init within
	  selectCameraManipulator to force the new minpulator to update
	  correctly.

2005-11-07 14:42 +0000 [r4691]  robert:

	* From David Spilling, added "noRotation" ReaderWriter::Option into
	  the .obj plugin to enable disabling of the automatic rotation
	  from Y up coordinate frame to Z up coordinate frame.

	* From Gideon May, compile fixes for OSX.

2005-11-07 11:09 +0000 [r4687]  robert:

	* From Norman Vine, "Cygwin uses unix style path separators"

2005-11-07 11:05 +0000 [r4686]  robert:

	* From Wang Lam,"The changes allow users of OpenSceneGraph to call
	  a new function readFontStream() to load fonts from a
	  std::istream, rather than from the local filesystem by name. Such
	  a call may be used, for example, if the user has a font fetched
	  over a network, or a font available in memory without a
	  correspondng filename. The changes implement the new function by
	  following the corresponding code for readFontFile().
	  readFontStream() reads a stream into memory, and holds that
	  memory for FreeType. As a basic test, I mangled the osgtext
	  example to use readFontStream(std::ifstream("font")) in lieu of a
	  readFontFile call, and the modified example ran completely."

2005-11-07 10:29 +0000 [r4685]  robert:

	* From Ruben (with a few addition/changes from Robert), fixed the
	  commandline of the osgsimplifier example. It now reads --ratio
	  and --max-error.

	* Improvements to CameraNode IO support, now handles render to
	  texture.

2005-11-03 19:20 +0000 [r4681]  robert:

	* Changed the CameraNode read/write code to use Transform as its
	  parent.

2005-11-03 17:12 +0000 [r4680]  robert:

	* Removed debugging message

2005-11-03 17:08 +0000 [r4679]  robert:

2005-11-02 15:23 +0000 [r4662]  robert:

	* Added handling of CameraNode into PickVisitor in
	  src/osgProducer/Viewer.cpp. This is unlikely to be the final
	  solution, but does at least fix part of the problem of handling
	  picking HUD's underneath CameraNodes.

	  sizes. From Robert Osfield, made the background colour of the
	  intersted camera a scaled down verson of the main background
	  colour to make it more obvious.

2005-11-02 12:22 +0000 [r4659]  robert:

	* Added a setSupportsDisplayList(false) to constructor to prevent
	  end users enabling display lists, something that can break the
	  osgText's managment of state.

2005-11-02 11:55 +0000 [r4658]  robert:

	* Fixed setCameraRequiresSetUp so it properly uses the bool passed
	  to it.

2005-11-02 11:33 +0000 [r4657]  robert:

	* Added doc comment and removed redundent inline keyword

2005-11-02 10:57 +0000 [r4655-4656]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I need the ability to check for a font
	  file without actually loading the font object. I've modified
	  font.h/cpp of osgText so that it exports the findFontFile
	  function."

	* From Marco Jez, commented out debuggin message.

2005-11-02 10:49 +0000 [r4654]  robert:

	* Added static orthoNormal function to match equivilant in Matrixd

	* From Colin McDonald, "Fixes for some duplicate global symbol
	  definitions in the plugins, which cause errors when creating a
	  statically linked executable."

	* Fixed compile warning

2005-11-01 20:16 +0000 [r4650]  robert:

	* Changed the error number reporting to be reported as hex.

2005-11-01 19:32 +0000 [r4648-4649]  robert:

	  commandline docs for the new --image and --texture-rectangle
	  options.

	* Removed the double call to the camera post draw callback.

2005-11-01 17:07 +0000 [r4647]  robert:

	* Added usage of image copy and modification.

2005-11-01 15:39 +0000 [r4646]  robert:

	* Set the draw and read buffer to GL_NONE when using FBO's, thereby
	  avoid invalid enumrates being generated.

	* Improved handling of osg::Image copying.

2005-11-01 11:18 +0000 [r4644]  robert:

	* Added RenderTargetFallback option into osg::CameraNode.

2005-10-31 16:40 +0000 [r4641]  robert:

	* From Steve Lunsford, "Attached is a copy of TXPNode.cpp with the
	  repaired computeBounds call. I discovered that TXPNodes were
	  being culled out prematurely because the loaded sub-tiles
	  resulted in a computed bounds that was smaller than the extents
	  indicated in the archive. I think this fix should be fine. I
	  can't think of any reason why we would want to use anything other
	  than the archive extents."

2005-10-31 14:48 +0000 [r4640]  robert:

	* Added default setting of _threading_model to ThreadPerCamera when
	  multiple cameras are present, and SingleThreaded when a single
	  camera is being used.

2005-10-31 11:43 +0000 [r4639]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, "some tweaks to the osgSim lightpoints. -
	  The first change is to start fadeing a lightpoint just before the
	  maximum distance of a light is reached. - The second change is to
	  start fading a lightpoint when pixelSize is less than
	  _minPixelSize instead of 1.0."

2005-10-29 11:29 +0000 [r4638]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, Fix for the class name lookup in
	  osgDB::Registry::writeObject(), which can silently fail when a

	  as that of an OSG's class (for example osg::Program).

	* Fixed env var docs for sharing graphics contexts.

2005-10-28 14:02 +0000 [r4633]  robert:

	* Added warning message for when no file is loaded.

2005-10-28 13:18 +0000 [r4632]  robert:

	* From Ravi Mathur, "Here is an update to BlendEquation that adds
	  checking for the SGIX_blend_alpha_minmax and EXT_blend_logic_op
	  extensions. It is tested with the osgblendequation example. If
	  the extensions are not supported, a WARN level notification is
	  generated."

2005-10-28 13:11 +0000 [r4631]  robert:

	* Moved SceneView across to use an osg::CameraNode to store the
	  projection and view matrices, the viewport, the clear colour and
	  the subgraph needing rendered. This is done transparently so all
	  existing functionality will behave as before. What it does add is
	  the ability to set a SceneView directly by a single
	  osg::CameraNode when required.

2005-10-28 10:33 +0000 [r4630]  robert:

	* Changed debug message from NOTICE to INFO level of notification

2005-10-28 10:11 +0000 [r4629]  robert:

	* Added command line option --overlay to turn on the use of an
	  OverlayNode.

	* Added documentation line about 32 being the maximum permitted
	  number of line segmenets

2005-10-27 11:11 +0000 [r4624]  robert:

	* Added error message to report when too many line segments are
	  added to an IntersectVisitor.

2005-10-27 10:48 +0000 [r4623]  robert:

	* Added support for tracking the directory of the output file
	  whilst still maintaining local file references within this
	  directory.

2005-10-27 09:38 +0000 [r4621-4622]  robert:

	* From Ravi Mathur, "New functionality is the ability to
	  automatically determine the maximum traversal depth necessary to
	  obtain an accurate estimate of the minimum number of required
	  cameras. In addition, the user can specify an absolute maximum
	  traversal depth that will not be exceeded."

	* From Geoff Michel, update to osgdelaunday.

2005-10-26 20:30 +0000 [r4620]  robert:

	* From Don Tidrow, bug fix to setOutputTextureFiles(bool).

2005-10-26 20:22 +0000 [r4619]  robert:

	* Added friend declarations of nested classes to prevent compile
	  problems under VS6.0

2005-10-26 20:00 +0000 [r4618]  robert:

	* Changed the minimum tile image size to be 4x4 to avoid problems
	  in mipmap generation that was occuring at sizes of 2x2, seemingly
	  somewhere in the OpenGL driver.

2005-10-26 16:02 +0000 [r4617]  robert:

	* From Bob Kuehne, "changed two set methods
	  (setFocalLength,setFieldOfView) to perform assignment."

2005-10-26 09:22 +0000 [r4616]  robert:

	* From Geoff Michel, compile fixes for VS6.0

	* From Farshid Lashkari & Robert Osfield: Added support for
	  VERTICAL_INTERLACE and HORIZONTAL_INTERLACE stereo modes use the
	  stencil buffer.

2005-10-25 14:01 +0000 [r4612]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-25 13:28 +0000 [r4611]  robert:

	* From Geoff Michel, added support for constrain delaunay
	  triangultion, and osgdelaunay example.

	* Added missing projects

	* Added osgcatch project

2005-10-25 10:12 +0000 [r4607]  robert:

	* Added missing projects.

2005-10-25 09:54 +0000 [r4606]  robert:

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, added meanigful return types in
	  Registry::read(const ReadFunctor& readFunctor) for
	  ERROR_IN_READING_FILE and FILE_NOT_FOUND cases.

2005-10-25 09:49 +0000 [r4605]  robert:

	* Added protected destructors.

2005-10-25 09:43 +0000 [r4604]  robert:

	* From Don Tidrow, removed unncessary includes.

2005-10-25 09:23 +0000 [r4603]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, changed osg_InverseViewMatrix to
	  osg_ViewMatrixInverse to bring into line with OpenGL shader
	  languague conventions. From Robert Osfield, changed the
	  SceneView::ActiveUnforms enum to from INVERSE_VIEW_MATRIX_UNIFORM
	  VIEW_MATRIX_INVERSE_UNIFORM to be convistent with the above
	  change.

2005-10-24 18:51 +0000 [r4602]  robert:

	* Changes to fix divide by 0 warning under VS.

2005-10-24 13:49 +0000 [r4600-4601]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

	* Fixed compile warnings.

2005-10-24 11:46 +0000 [r4598-4599]  robert:

	* From Mike Weiblen, "some fixes for OSG_OPTIMIZER envar parsing
	  and help display"

	* From Marco Jez, added missing example project files.

2005-10-24 11:37 +0000 [r4596-4597]  robert:

	* From Tony Horrobin: "This is a small fix for flt2osg.[cpp|h] that
	  handles old style road segments ( from Multigen II w/road tools
	  on IRIX ) in the same way as the newer road constructions. ie
	  create a group and do a nested traversal. This makes roads appear
	  in older format files where there was previously a gap. This
	  actually works properly with the paths which are marked as hidden
	  in the openflight database."

	* From Don Tidrow, "I discovered that externally-referenced models
	  in the TXP format didn't get positioned correctly when the TXP
	  database was built using the 'tile-offset' mode. I've included a
	  tarball with what I believe are the needed changes - they work
	  for the sample databases I have available, but not all conditions
	  have been tested. I've set things up such that these changes
	  shouldn't affect 'normal' txp databases."

2005-10-24 11:25 +0000 [r4595]  robert:

	* Warning fixes for Win32 build.

2005-10-24 10:53 +0000 [r4593-4594]  robert:

	* Added copyright notices.

	* Added beginnings of Programming Guide, and NodeTrackerCallback.

2005-10-14 21:40 +0000 [r4591-4592]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, compile fix for VS 2002.

	* From Brede Johansen, fixed INVERSE_VIEW_MATRIX_UNIFORM enum
	  value.

2005-10-14 09:29 +0000 [r4590]  robert:

	* From Farshid Laskari, changed the compute of the text bounding
	  box to include the spaces.

2005-10-13 12:51 +0000 [r4589]  robert:

	* Renamed osgUtil::RenderGraph to osgUtil::StateGraph

2005-10-13 10:29 +0000 [r4588]  robert:

	* Changed the "Cessna" text so that it is sized according to
	  OBJECT_COORDS rather than SCREEN_COORDS as the later was causing
	  problems with the pixel size based LOD selection.

2005-10-13 08:18 +0000 [r4587]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-13 08:07 +0000 [r4585-4586]  robert:

	* Added Producer.lib to osgdepthpartion project file

	* Added PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes make options to the unix build
	  system, not defining PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes or setting it to
	  another value than yes (i.e no) will result in the osgProducer
	  library, OSG applications and demos not being built.
	  PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes is the default.

2005-10-12 18:42 +0000 [r4584]  robert:

	* Added SmokeTrailEffect which renders created particles as single
	  quad or line strip, in the case of the quad strip the strip is
	  aligned to the be orthogonal with the eye point.

2005-10-11 09:47 +0000 [r4583]  robert:

	* Added new shell of new class ConnectedParticleSystem, which will
	  be used for managing connect particle system for the purpose of
	  doing missile trails etc.

2005-10-10 10:10 +0000 [r4582]  robert:

	* From Ravi Mathur, osgdepthpartition example program.

2005-10-10 09:17 +0000 [r4581]  robert:

	* From Alberto Jaspe, added double precision interpolation method

2005-10-07 07:46 +0000 [r4580]  robert:

	* Added into CVS missing PolgonMode files.

2005-10-06 20:02 +0000 [r4579]  robert:

	* Improved the UpdateCameraAndTexGenCallback so it properly handles
	  rotation and translations within the reflector nodepath.

2005-10-06 15:43 +0000 [r4577-4578]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, added support for PolygonMode into .ive
	  format.

	* Changed the fallback code to use the result form the realize()
	  call, removed the code path from running a PBuffer as a seperate
	  graphics context (this was found to be slower than running single
	  threaded so its not worth the extra complexity).

2005-10-06 13:31 +0000 [r4576]  robert:

	* Added env var reporting for the OSG_CAMERA_THREADING and
	  OSG_SHARE_GRAPHICS_CONTEXTS env vars.

2005-10-06 13:20 +0000 [r4575]  robert:

	* Added catch for disabling ThreadPerCamera when contexts are
	  shared.

2005-10-06 11:26 +0000 [r4574]  robert:

	* Improved the fallback mechanism from FBO, down to PBuffer_RTT
	  down to PBuffer down to frame buffer.

2005-10-05 16:21 +0000 [r4573]  robert:

	* Moved the testing and setting up of FBO/Pbuffer extension from
	  CullVisitor to support into RenderStage to allow better fallback
	  implementations.

2005-10-05 09:48 +0000 [r4572]  robert:

	* Added support for CameraView into NodeVistor, and support for
	  CameraNode and CameraView into the AnimationPathCallback so you
	  can now animate both via animation paths.

2005-10-04 18:50 +0000 [r4571]  robert:

	* Added code paths for PBuffer RTT support.

2005-10-04 13:41 +0000 [r4570]  robert:

	* Added osg::CameraView to help application/modellers position
	  their cameras in scenes. Note, CameraView is *not* a camera, it
	  isn't an active object, but a passive one that camera must track
	  each frame to following the path of the CameraView.

2005-10-03 19:37 +0000 [r4569]  robert:

	* From Keith Steffen, fixed bug in StateSet::clear() where parents
	  of texture attributes where not being reset correctly due to
	  incorrect ordering of _textureAttributeList.clear().

2005-10-03 19:33 +0000 [r4568]  robert:

	* From MFM, Added FreeBSD specific implementation for
	  getGLExtensionFuncPtr using dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, xxx)

2005-10-03 19:24 +0000 [r4567]  robert:

	* Added a couple of (double) casts for VS7 build.

2005-10-03 19:18 +0000 [r4566]  robert:

	* Added closing of loops.

2005-10-03 16:13 +0000 [r4565]  robert:

	* Added fusing of ends of lines

2005-10-03 13:19 +0000 [r4564]  robert:

	* Improved handling of convex azim ranges.

2005-10-01 19:28 +0000 [r4562-4563]  robert:

	* Added test cases for SphereSegment intersection code.

	* Added a dirtyDisplayList() to the setColor() and
	  setTesselationHint() methods.

2005-10-01 12:23 +0000 [r4561]  robert:

	* Adding handling of case of convex azimuth side ways of sphere
	  segment.

2005-09-30 19:36 +0000 [r4560]  robert:

	* Changed the line intersection algorithm to computer full line
	  intersections then trim down to size by intersecting with the
	  sphere segmenet sufaces

2005-09-29 15:55 +0000 [r4559]  robert:

	* Fix to intersection code.

2005-09-29 13:07 +0000 [r4558]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, fix for gcc build.

2005-09-29 10:25 +0000 [r4556]  robert:

	* Fixed typo of Primitive

2005-09-29 10:22 +0000 [r4555]  robert:

	* Added setOverlayClearColor and setTexEnvMode and automatic set up
	  of TexEnv.

2005-09-29 09:49 +0000 [r4554]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, added fallback to TextureCubeMap subloading that
	  calls load when mipmaps are required, but non are present.

2005-09-29 09:36 +0000 [r4553]  robert:

	* Fixed typo of CameraNode::setRenderTargetImplementation(..)

2005-09-28 16:05 +0000 [r4552]  robert:

	* From Volker Walkiewicz (with tweaks from Robert Osfield): Fix to
	  the update of the error metrics on the edges in the
	  simplification mesh that are affected by an edge collapse.
	  Addition of 'n' and 'p' keyboard control in osgsimplifier example
	  to allow users to control the sample ratio manually.

2005-09-28 14:18 +0000 [r4551]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, "Problems fixed: 1. type converters created
	  automatically by the I_BaseType macro use static_cast<> even for
	  base-to-derived conversions. dynamic_cast<> should be used
	  instead. 2. as a consequence of the above fix, I_BaseType must
	  now differentiate between polymorphic and non-polymorphic base
	  classes, because the latter can't be dynamic_cast'd to derived
	  classes. Some template magic (see is_polymorphic<> in
	  ReflectionMacros) is used to detect polymorphism at compile time
	  (I'm NOT sure it works on all platforms as it's partly
	  implementation-dependent. Please test!). 3. predefined custom
	  property getters/setters/counters/etc. (as those defined for STL
	  containers) only work on Value objects that contain non-pointer
	  instances. This was an unwanted restriction that no longer
	  exists. Wrappers will need to be recompiled. This is a good time
	  to give them a fresh update with genwrapper. NOTE: fix #1 should
	  get rid of those crashes and strange behaviours that some users
	  noticed while using osgIntrospection through osgTcl or in their
	  own code."

2005-09-28 14:05 +0000 [r4550]  robert:

	* From Chris Hanson, "The following files are drop-in replacements
	  for the include/*/Export files to permit building statically
	  linked osg libraries under Win32."

2005-09-28 13:55 +0000 [r4547-4548]  robert:

	* From Leandro Motta Barros: fixed type of ATTRIBUTE_*

	* From A. Botorabi, "slightly modified osgUtil's
	  TangentSpaceGenerator class to allow the option for using or not
	  using geom's indices for tangent space vectors generation. now,
	  Ruben's code is also used (it was disabled before). in order to
	  keep backward compatibility, the compute method behaves as before
	  in default case."

2005-09-28 13:45 +0000 [r4546]  robert:

	* From Joran Jessurun, comments explaining font search rules

2005-09-28 13:39 +0000 [r4545]  robert:

	* From Joran Jessurun, added font search fallbck that strips the
	  leading path from the font file and then looks again.

2005-09-28 13:33 +0000 [r4544]  robert:

	* From Chris Hanson: Spelling fixes in include/osg/LOD Negated
	  priority in PagedLOD when using _rangeMode==PIXEL_SIZE_ON_SCREEN
	  Added clampedPixelSize() methods to CullStack and CullingSet to
	  return fabs()ed values. Changed LOD and PagedLOD ::traverse to
	  use clampedPixelSize() methods.

2005-09-27 20:28 +0000 [r4543]  robert:

	* Added degugging methods.

2005-09-27 14:48 +0000 [r4542]  robert:

2005-09-24 16:11 +0000 [r4537]  don:

	* Brede's changes for limited morphed vertex support. These changes
	  allow a model with morphed vertecies to load correctly with LOD
	  switches, but does not implement the vertex morphing.

2005-09-24 14:53 +0000 [r4536]  robert:

	* Improvements to the clipping of polygons at boundary edges.

2005-09-21 14:38 +0000 [r4535]  robert:

	* From Mike Weiblen: support for OSGHANGGLIDE_REVERSE_CONTROLS env
	  which reverses the pitch and roll control to account from Mike's
	  "unique" way of flying hang gliders :-)

2005-09-19 15:28 +0000 [r4532]  robert:

	* From Ravi Mathur, added extension checks for point sprite
	  support. From Robert Osfield, tweaks of the above to use
	  osg::buffer_object and a local struct to store initialized to
	  help with multi-thread and out of order context usage.

2005-09-19 14:07 +0000 [r4531]  robert:

	* Added support for "-O OutputTextureFiles" options string in .osg
	  plugin to allow texture files to be written out when writing out
	  a .osg file.

2005-09-19 13:15 +0000 [r4530]  robert:

	* Added countMultipleIntersections to help with debugging.

2005-09-17 18:50 +0000 [r4529]  robert:

	* Improved the region classifaction of the intersection code.

2005-09-16 14:52 +0000 [r4528]  robert:

	* Improved accuracy of spheresegment to mesh intersections uses
	  mathematical models of surface geometry.

2005-09-16 09:28 +0000 [r4527]  robert:

	* Added Azimuth and Elevation intersector functors.

2005-09-15 20:55 +0000 [r4526]  robert:

	* Changed destinationRowDelta and destination_pixelSpace to int's,
	  solving a memory corruption crash under 64 bit build.

	* Added querry of video size during open() call and associated
	  allocImage to ensure that the imagestream passed back is of a
	  valid size.

2005-09-11 19:12 +0000 [r4522]  robert:

	* From Henrique Bucher, add check against null light entry in
	  LightPool.

2005-09-11 19:08 +0000 [r4521]  robert:

	* From Farshid Lashkari, append "\fonts" to end of windows font
	  search path.

2005-09-11 19:05 +0000 [r4520]  robert:

	* From Sondra Iverson, "The options to rewind/restart and to toggle
	  looping in the osgmovie example have been implemented. "

2005-09-11 19:02 +0000 [r4518-4519]  robert:

2005-09-09 11:13 +0000 [r4512]  robert:

	* Added triangle index functor to src/osgUtil/SphereSegment.cpp for
	  computing the intersection between an indivual geometry and the
	  sphere segment. Converted the terrain in osgspheresegment to be
	  an osg::Geometry based drawable rather than a
	  osg::ShapeDrawable/osg::HeightField one to make it more practicle
	  to use as a test for the new SphereSegment intersection code.

2005-09-08 18:56 +0000 [r4511]  robert:

	* Added PolytopeVisitor to SphereSegment.cpp to help cull down to
	  only drawables that intersect with the frustum of the
	  SphereSegment. PolytopeVisitor may eventually be pulled out to be
	  more generally used along the lines of osgUtil::IntersectVisitor.

2005-09-08 13:10 +0000 [r4510]  robert:

	  the extents of objects that will be influenced by it.

2005-09-06 20:28 +0000 [r4508]  robert:

	* Added a grid of lines into the OverlaySubgraph to demonstate use

	  having with certain FLT files that only had partial colour
	  palettes Which are typically found in older 14.x files and file
	  converted through Polytrans or Deep exploration etc. The code
	  that grabs the color entries in ConvertFromFLT::visitColorPalette
	  was assuming that there were full palettes always coming in and
	  stepping was out of bounds in certain cases (not all) and thus
	  crashing with access violations etc, Although the normal from
	  Creator is to have 1024 or 512 entries , this is not a really
	  requirement of the format, just the way Creator creates its
	  default palettes etc. Code changed to look at the number of
	  entries and use just those and fills in any missing entries with
	  a default white colour"

	  calculateUpperLowerBBCorners() from the Plane(const Vec3& v1,
	  const Vec3& v2, const Vec3& v3) since the constructor is using
	  the function set(const Vec3& v1, const Vec3& v2, const Vec3& v3)
	  which already computes the upper and lower bounding box."

	  option store the RGBE values into a Image, to use this option you
	  need to decode the RGBE value in the frag- ment shader. Follow
	  the cube map glsl decoder: vec4 textureCubeRGBE( uniform
	  samplerCube sampler, vec3 coords ) { ivec4 rgbe = textureCube(
	  sampler, coords ) * 255. + 0.5; float e = rgbe.a - ( 128 + 8 );
	  return vec4( rgbe.rgb * exp2( e ), 1.0 ); } This option is
	  usefull for who have a outdate hardware like FX cards and want to
	  do cool things. Finally this patch is need by a new HDR Rendering
	  example that I will put on the Wiki."

2005-07-26 21:07 +0000 [r4420]  robert:

	* From Jeremy Bell, "My patch is a slight refactoring of the mac
	  specific code in Registry.cpp and FileUtils.cpp, specifically
	  around the library and resource file path initilialization
	  methods. This patch cleans up a lot of the mac specific code by
	  moving repeated code into separate local functions in
	  FileUtils.cpp that are only compiled on mac builds. It also adds
	  one function to the API, appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths
	  in FileUtils. This function will mirror the already existing
	  appendPlatformSpecificLibraryFilePaths except for resource file
	  paths. Currently this function is empty except when built on the
	  mac, in which case it will add the application bundle's internal
	  Resources folder and the bundle's parent folder. Previously this
	  code was implemented as a separate mac specific #ifdef block in
	  Registry.cpp around the initDataFilePathList method. However, it
	  now is implemented in appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in
	  FileUtils.cpp and the initDataFilePathList method is now the same
	  on all platforms. This patch should behave the same as before on
	  non-mac platforms. This patch already includes the fix that Eric
	  mentioned earlier. This patch is based off of the 0.99 release
	  code. I have tested this patch using the following testing
	  scheme: Make a proper bundled application. While Run from the
	  Finder: Test that it finds plugins in its internal plugins path.
	  Test that it finds resources in its internal resources path. Test
	  that it finds resources in the bundle's parent directory Test
	  that it finds plugins in the user's Application Support Directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the system's Application Support
	  Directory Test that it finds plugins in the Network Application
	  Support Directory Check the plugin and resource path lists after
	  they have been initialized to see if they are in the correct
	  order While Run from the command line (both from it's parent
	  directory and from inside the /Contents/MacOS directory) and
	  repeat the above tests. Check that it also finds plugins and
	  resources within the paths defined by various environment
	  variables. Now, Make an application that is NOT bundled/command
	  line only Test that it does NOT try to look in an internal bundle
	  plugin/resource directory for plugins or resources. Test that it
	  finds plugins/resources in the paths defined by the environment
	  variables. "

2005-06-24 20:19 +0000 [r4358]  robert:

	* From David Spilling, fixed the incircle test so it handles
	  colinear points.

2005-06-24 19:50 +0000 [r4357]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald, "On fixing the pointer access I discovered
	  that reading osga archives containing ive files went into a cpu
	  loop. This turned out to be a problem with proxy_streambuf on
	  Solaris. Public methods in the Solaris streambuf standard library
	  implementation rely on the gptr() being set, which
	  proxy_streambuf was not doing. So I have modified proxy_streambuf
	  to set the input sequence pointers, and have also aligned it more
	  with the standard library streambuf implementation where all
	  input is through underflow(), not uflow() which merely calls
	  underflow() and advances the pointer." From Robert Osfield,
	  change from using pointer cast and assignment to using a
	  templated _write and _read method to avoid pointer aliasing to
	  2/4/8 byte boundaries that some computer system may produce.
	  These changes where inspried by Colin McDonalds change to using
	  memcpy, these changes weren't merged as memcpy is not as clear in
	  naming as _read, _write and memcpy will incurr a function call
	  just for copy a uint.

2005-06-24 15:39 +0000 [r4356]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald: "Some makedefs fixes for Solaris: For
	  multithreaded applications the -mt option must be specified on
	  both the compile and link steps, to ensure correct behaviour.
	  According to the Sun compiler documentation it sets REENTRANT
	  flags in the system header files, and links the -lthread library
	  in the correct order. When compiling shared libraries the -KPIC
	  option should be specified. Although Solaris will handle shared
	  libraries without position-independent code there is a
	  performance penalty. The linker reference manual says: 'If a
	  shared object is built from code that is not
	  position-independent, the text segment will usually require a
	  large number of relocations to be performed at runtime. Although
	  the runtime linker is equipped to handle this, the system
	  overhead this creates can cause serious performance
	  degradation'."

2005-06-24 15:34 +0000 [r4355]  robert:

	* From Martijn Kragtwijk: "I ran into the same problems as Karl
	  Martensson
	  (http://openscenegraph.org/archiver/osg-users/2005-June/0575.html);
	  after switching children of a Switch node off and on again, they
	  become unpickable. This issue occurs first in 0.9.9, with 0.9.8
	  everything is fine. My fix involves calling dirtyBound() every
	  time the on/off-values of the Switch are changed"

2005-06-24 15:30 +0000 [r4354]  robert:

	* From David Guthrie, "The call NSLookupAndBindSymbol was changed
	  to NSLookupSymbolInModule. The former call would lookup the named
	  symbol NOT in the current dynamic library, but in the entire
	  running program while the call NSLookupSymbolInModule, takes the
	  handle to the library the symbol should be found in. This means
	  the current code will fail if one loads multiple bundles at
	  runtime and attempts to load the same named symbol from each
	  one."

2005-06-24 15:15 +0000 [r4353]  robert:

	* Moved the working createPagedLODScene() implemention into
	  createScene() method replacing the original flaky code.

	  osg::Image is assigned. This is useful for FBO usage.

2005-06-15 11:49 +0000 [r4334]  robert:

	* From David Guthrie, " In the constructor in removes any options
	  beginning with "-psn" from argv on OSX by calling the "remove"
	  method. When a .app run is created in OSX, which is required to
	  get a fully functioning UI application, the OSX finder passes a
	  -psn_XXXX option to the application where the XXXX refers to a
	  unique process number. An example option would be "-
	  psn_0_37617665". The argument parser was choking on this option
	  in all the osg example applications."

2005-06-15 10:59 +0000 [r4333]  robert:

	  order actually matches the embedded documentation"

2005-06-06 10:18 +0000 [r4315]  robert:

	* From Mathia Walker: bug fix to LOD ranges in TXP plugin to avoid
	  cracks: "I took a closer look at the conditional code in
	  SeamFinder::seamReplacement(). Because _info.minRange is a double
	  and lod->getMinRange(0) is a float, the difference will be
	  calculated with double precision. If _info.minRange is cast as a
	  float it is exactly the same value as lod->getMinRange(0) and the
	  difference is exactly zero. So if you change
	  if((fabs(_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs(_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))
	  to
	  if((fabs((float)_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs((float)_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))
	  it works a lot better."

	* Changed VisualStudio 7.0 reference to 7.x

	* From Adam Richard, fixed typos + explanation how to use project
	  files.

2005-05-31 06:21 +0000 [r4312]  robert:

	* From Tim Daust, "I fixed the getScale functions in matrixf and
	  matrixd. It was returning the values of the diagonal of the
	  matrix, which only returns the scale if there is not a rotation.
	  I fixed this by returning the length of the vectors that form the
	  basis. I also added a function to orthonormalize the rotation
	  component of the matrix. I seem to always run into situations
	  where non uniform (or even uniform) scale complicate my
	  calculations, and I thought other members of the community could
	  use this function as well."

2005-04-14 07:55 +0000 [r4031]  robert:

	* From Joson Daly, fix for forward/backward/swing animation
	  handling both 15.8 and versions prior to 15.8, and... " Here's
	  another fix for OpenFlight. The symptom was that ATTR files were
	  not being read correctly, and the TexEnv on a texture that should
	  have been set to DECAL was instead defaulting to MODULATE. The
	  cause is that the ATTR reader cannot tell by itself what version
	  it's reading (the version information isn't present in the ATTR
	  files), and instead relies on the ReaderWriter::Options passed in
	  to get the OpenFlight version. My change clones the current
	  ReaderWriter::Options and prepends the appropriate FLT_VER option
	  before the ReaderWriterATTR object is called. I also made the
	  parsing of the FLT_VER string and value more robust in the
	  ReaderWriterATTR itself. I think I commented things OK, but let
	  me know if you need me to explain anything."

2005-04-04 11:18 +0000 [r3959]  robert:

	* From Alberto Farre: "Here there are fixes for several flt loader
	  problems. First one was an small bug when root database was an
	  empty string we got a database path "/" instead of "./". Second
	  one is more complex. Flt loader works in two passes, first one
	  reads flt database and second one builds osg scenegraph. Special
	  care must be taken for properly tracking database path as nested
	  files are entered. Because textures are loaded in second pass,
	  mentioned care should be taken once again. I wrote time ago a
	  piece of code and I placed it in both files fltFile.cpp and
	  flt2osg.cpp. After a long period offline I have seen the portion
	  of code at flt2osg was missing, I just made some tests and I
	  could see it is still required. Finally, I have seen that
	  pool.cpp always try to make IMAGE cache instead of reading what
	  Options says. Aditonally, I recently wrote an osg change, now it
	  has external references "a la flt" what is called osg::ProxyNode.
	  As part of the change now flt loader builds external references
	  as ProxyNodes. I made the same mistake like pool.cpp and always
	  made ARCHIVE cache instead of see what Options says, it has also
	  been fixed."

	  New codes produces errors when running osgfxbrowser cow.osg so I
	  have elected to keep the original implementation of
	  compute_basis_vectors around and as the default compile to keep

2005-03-07 12:14 +0000 [r3874]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, "Current version of the LWO plugin creates one
	  Geode with a single Geometry for each Lighwave surface, in order
	  to keep surface names (geometries can't have names). The attached
	  fix adds a plugin option named "COMBINE_GEODES" that allows to
	  place all geometries under a single Geode whenever possible, thus
	  offering better chances of further optimization through
	  osgUtil::Optimizer. The downside is that surface names are no
	  longer stored in the scene graph when using this option."

	  options string I use the same method as used in the LWO
	  reader/writer. "

2004-05-09 06:29 +0000 [r2976]  robert:

	* From Mike Weiblen, Fixes for Win32 build

2004-05-08 22:18 +0000 [r2975]  robert:

	* From Corbin Holtz, "I have completed my mods to the OpenFlight
	  loader (modified files are attached): * Light point strings using
	  the REPLICATE opcode should now be supported (>=15.6?) *
	  Directional lights should now work as in Performer using a
	  viewing frustrum defined by a direction vector, horizontal
	  angular width, vertical angular width, and roll angle about the
	  direction vector. The current directional light implementation
	  had some bad assumptions which caused problems with direction
	  vectors not on the XY plane. * IVE and OSG reader/writers were
	  updated as appropriate"

2004-05-08 21:33 +0000 [r2974]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz, "Changes to provide rudimentary support for OF
	  15.8 light point animation palettes. This change also includes
	  light point palette override support for external references.
	  This is the last of my code changes to support OF 15.8 in the flt
	  loader. Barring bugs, of course, knock on wood. The gist of the
	  animation palette code is to create ref_ptr'd
	  osgSim::BlinkSequence objects for each palette entry, and then
	  pass them on to osgSim::LightPoint for any OpenFlight light
	  points that reference that palette entry. This should be
	  conservative of memory (not that I expect the animation palette
	  to be extremely large)."

	* From Paul Marz : "Input.h, Input.cpp -- Here's where support for
	  reading the continuation record goes. I added a new function to
	  read a continued record body. I added code in the existing
	  ReadRecord routine to peek ahead for a CONTINUATION_OP if the
	  current record could possibly be continued. opcodes.h -- Besides
	  adding the opcode for CONTINUATION_OP, I also added new 15.8
	  opcodes. I labeled opcodes as "ignored" if I could easily discern
	  that our loader wasn't doing anything with them. For historical
	  reasons, I added all obsolete opcodes, prefixed with "OBS_".
	  LocalVertexPoolRecord.h, LocalVertexPoolRecord.cpp -- This is one
	  of three types of records that can be continued with a
	  CONTINUATION_OP record. I removed all invalid assertions that
	  assumed the record length would always be less than 65535. I
	  replaced the "vertex size" calculation with a more efficient
	  method based on caching the size from attribute bits, rather than
	  taking the length of the record and dividing it by numVerts
	  (which would have been incorrect if the record had been
	  continued)."

2004-03-05 15:44 +0000 [r2778]  robert:

	* From Marco Jez, on behalf of Farshid Lashkari. Details from
	  Marco's email: "I've just received an addition to osgParticle
	  from Farshid Lashkari. It enhances the generation of texture
	  coordinates on particles so that animated textures can be used,
	  with the current frame of animation being computed from each
	  particle's current age. Clients just have to call
	  Particle::setTextureTile() and specify the number of horizontal
	  and vertical tiles that make the animation up in the texture
	  image."

2004-03-04 18:35 +0000 [r2777]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz/Robert Osfield. Addition of initializers in

	* From Paul Martz, with a couple of mods by Robert Osfield:
	  "Changes to return the lat/long origin of an OpenFlight model as
	  userData of the root node object."

2004-03-02 15:37 +0000 [r2762]  robert:

	* From Paul Martz: "These two files fix the alignment bug in the
	  flt plugin header parsing, which I posted about on Saturday. They
	  go in the flt plugin directory. The fix is to memcpy the data
	  read from the flt file into individual fields in our Header
	  struct, then replace the raw (packed) data block with our header
	  struct. This avoids the alignment problem entirely, and all
	  fields now contain valid data."

	* Changed the default wrap modes from REPEAT to CLAMP since CLAMP
	  is the OpenGL default value.

2003-12-15 16:46 +0000 [r2540]  robert:

	* Added two news examples, osgsimple just loads a model and then
	  renders it in a single window. osgkeyboardmouse adds to osgsimple

	  the task of iterating through the list of available reader
	  writer, whilst handling cases where the list itself changes size
	  during iteration through the list. Previous size changes during
	  iteration was cause invalid iterators, which in turn was causing
	  a crash.

	  support.

2003-12-09 12:11 +0000 [r2510-2515]  robert:

	* Added new example osgphotoalbum.

	* Reverted back to non exception based JPEG plugin.

	* Addition of the following methods: /** Set the object-space
	  reference radius of the volume enclosed by the PagedLOD. * Used
	  to detmine the bounding sphere of the PagedLOD in the absense of
	  any children.*/ inline void setRadius(float radius) { _radius =
	  radius; } /** Get the object-space radius of the volume enclosed
	  by the PagedLOD.*/ inline float getRadius() const { return
	  _radius; } /** Set the number of children that the PagedLOD must
	  keep around, even if thay are older than their expiry time.*/
	  inline void setNumChildrenThatCannotBeExpired(unsigned int num) {
	  _numChildrenThatCannotBeExpired = num; } /** Get the number of
	  children that the PagedLOD must keep around, even if thay are
	  older than their expiry time.*/ unsigned int
	  getNumChildrenThatCannotBeExpired() const { return
	  _numChildrenThatCannotBeExpired; }

	  readerwriter to be obtained once its constructed.

	* Addition of Mode mode=MODULATE constructor.

	* Fixes for optional compile of GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA and GL_ALPHA
	  texture usage in fonts. Default to GL_ALPHA.

	* Moved the responsibility for finding file to load on to the
	  ReaderWriter plugins, instead of osgDB::Registry where it
	  original lay. This has been done to allow fileName strings to be
	  encode data rather than just file names, such as one requires
	  when using PagedLOD along with plugins for doing dynamic
	  tesselation.

2003-12-07 20:58 +0000 [r2500]  robert:

	* Added check against null being passed into std::string

	  an extra pass to doing tri stripping in the osgUtil::Optimzer.
	  Added validity checks into osg::TexEnvCombine to catch eronous
	  enumarant values. Improved the efficient of CullingSet's handling
	  of new transforms. Added a copy shared subgraphs and subdivision
	  code into osgUtil::Optimizer.

2003-12-03 21:28 +0000 [r2490]  robert:

	* Made removedExpiredChildren() virtual.

2003-12-02 21:38 +0000 [r2488-2489]  robert:

	  tree.

2003-11-28 22:39 +0000 [r2485]  robert:

	* From Ruben, >Fixed: The iv loader that uses Inventor library has
	  a little bug, if used with >osgconv, it doesn't write the images
	  to the converted file because it's >not setting the
	  osg::Image->setFilename()

2003-11-28 14:37 +0000 [r2484]  robert:

	  scene pointer.

2003-11-27 22:53 +0000 [r2481]  robert:

	* From Rune Schmidt Jensen, support for osgSim::VisibilityGroup in

	  Matrix and GeneralMatrix records as > ancillary records. If this
	  happens, this fix will only use one matrix to > create
	  osg::TransformMatrix node.

2003-11-26 16:56 +0000 [r2475]  robert:

2003-11-24 10:01 +0000 [r2443]  robert:

	* Changed the shadow colour so that it is now controlled via the
	  emissive light material rather than ambient, this allows it to
	  bypass any of the osg::Light values and control the resulting
	  shadow colour more directly.

2003-11-21 20:21 +0000 [r2442]  robert:

	* Removed the ScalarBar:: from the from of the
	  ScalarPrinter::printScalar() calls.

2003-11-21 19:33 +0000 [r2441]  robert:

2003-11-21 14:17 +0000 [r2437]  robert:

	* Changed the main to create a Group and then add the loaded scene
	  and HUD scene into this. This has been done to rework code nearer
	  to what Stephan Huber used to get round a crash under OSX when a
	  model was passed in. This crash suggest a problem in
	  dynamic_cast<> perhaps?

2003-11-21 13:45 +0000 [r2436]  robert:

	* From Romano J M Silva, changed osg::Texture2D::copyTexImage2D so
	  that it uses the _internalFormat for the texture format to read
	  rather than default to GL_RGBA. From Robert Osfield, changed the

	  it set the _internalFormat to GL_RGBA if is is zero.

2003-11-20 12:03 +0000 [r2435]  robert:

	  insertChild(index,child,value) into osg::Switch.

2003-11-20 11:07 +0000 [r2434]  robert:

	* Changed the freetype plugin so it keeps its own ref_ptr<Font> to
	  fonts that it creates, rather than have
	  osgText::Font::readFontFile() use the osgDB::Registry object
	  cache. This has been done to prevent problems when users flush
	  the object cache, which was causing a dangling pointer.

2003-11-19 20:30 +0000 [r2433]  robert:

	* Changed libgdal.lib to gdal.lib

	  osgProducer::Viewer/OsgCameraGroup across to using exclusively
	  Matrixd for internal computations and passing betwen
	  Manipulators, Producer and SceneView. Note, SceneView still uses
	  Matrix internally so will depend on what is set as the default in
	  include/osg/Matrix. Added the ability to
	  osgProducer::setDone/getDone(), kept done() as the method that
	  the viewer main loop uses for detecting the exit condition.

2003-09-05 20:52 +0000 [r2234]  robert:

	* Added a Matrix::value_type typedef'd trait into osg::Matrix,
	  defaulting its value to float, and converted the internal code
	  across to use value_type. This allows Matrix to be converted to
	  use double's simply by change the definition of value_type. Added
	  Matrix::glLoadlMatrix and Matrix::glMultMatrix() to help
	  encapsulate the changes between float and double matrix usage.
	  Updated code that uses Matrix so it doesn't assume float or
	  double matrices.

2003-09-03 08:14 +0000 [r2227]  robert:

2003-09-02 20:39 +0000 [r2224]  robert:

	* Merged changed to osgParticle from Marco Jez, the changes are
	  (quoted from email from Marco) "Most relevant news: 1) particle
	  systems now have the "freezeOnCull" property set to false by
	  default. Since it is an optimization, and using it may cause some
	  unwanted behaviors if not handled properly, it makes more sense
	  to turn it off by default. 2) new "LINE" shape mode which uses
	  GL_LINES to draw line segments that point to the direction of
	  motion. 3) particles can now have a rotation angle and angular
	  velocity. 4) new AngularAccelOperator applies angular
	  acceleration to particles. 5) particle processors such as
	  emitters and programs can have a "start", "end" and "reset" time
	  coordinate. For example, an emitter may be instructed to start
	  emitting particles only after a certain time, stop after another
	  amount of time and then start again. Update (2) is from Gideon
	  May. Updates (3) to (5) are from Douglas A. Pouk."

	  Matrixf, as part of prep for supporting both Matrixf (float) and
	  Matrixd (double). Added osg::Matrixf::glLoadMatrix() and
	  osg::Matrixf::glMultiMatrix() methods and changed corresponding
	  usage of glLoad/MultMatrixf() calls across to use these methods.
	  Again prep for support Matrixd. Fixes for VisualStudio 6.0
	  compile.

	  For example, make INST_LOCATION=/usr will place files at
	  /usr/include, /usr/lib, /usr/share/OpenSceneGraph.

2003-03-11 15:25 +0000 [r1677]  robert:

	* Added support for AbortRendering flag pointer in osg::State which
	  is used by osgUtil::RenderLeaf to test if any abort state has
	  been set, if so it doesn't do any further drawing. The
	  osgProducer::Viewer has been set up to set the osg::State's it
	  manages with their AbortRendering flag pointers set to the
	  osgProducer::Viewer::_done memeber varaible. Now when escape is
	  pressed the rendering is aborted early.

2003-03-11 13:30 +0000 [r1676]  robert:

	* Bug fixes to osgText to handle the osgUtil::Optimizer being used
	  on a scene graph containing text. Fixed warning in MD2 plugin.

2003-03-11 13:24 +0000 [r1675]  robert:

	* Added missing osgDB:: to writeArray() usage.

	* Improvements to the Text .osg support.

2003-03-10 12:06 +0000 [r1673]  robert:

	* Addded new osgProducer based osgreflect demo.

2003-03-10 11:59 +0000 [r1671-1672]  robert:

	* Moved the RenderLeaf implementatation across to always applying
	  matrices before state, which fixes problem that can occur with
	  state that needs the current model view or projection matrices.
	  Changes osgreflect so that it uses ClipNode rather than clip
	  plane, thereby fixing the problems which occur when the above is
	  applied. Create a new osgProducer version of the original GLUT
	  based version.

	* Marged new getLibaryMethod added by Daniel.

2003-03-10 09:15 +0000 [r1670]  robert:

	* Moved the remain inline osg::Font methods into Font.cpp to avoid
	  problems with the impossibly stupid visual studio compilers.

2003-03-08 21:39 +0000 [r1669]  robert:

	* Fixed examples/osghud and osgtext Makefile's to include osgText.

2003-03-08 09:51 +0000 [r1668]  robert:

	* Removed the OSGTEXT_EXPORT symbol from FontImplementation to

2003-03-06 21:35 +0000 [r1664]  robert:

	* Added maximum width and maximum height limits to the
	  osgText::Text which automatically wraps text which goes beyond
	  these limits.

2003-03-06 19:41 +0000 [r1663]  robert:

	* Reverted the changes to ref_ptr<> for implicit cast to pointer.

2003-03-06 17:11 +0000 [r1662]  robert:

	* Changed the osgText::Font implementation so it used a facade us
	  abstract away the actual implemention. This has been done so that
	  when a freetype font is created the implementation can unloaded
	  when the freetype plugin is unloaded without breaking the main
	  font. Also add image margin around founds to prevent any image
	  boundaries appearing.

2003-03-06 13:45 +0000 [r1661]  robert:

	* Reverted the ref_ptr<> implementation to prior implicit cast
	  operator via commenting out// #define AUTOMATIC_CAST_TO_POINTER.

	* Add #ifndef's around the comparison operator's against const T*
	  now that the implicit cast operator has been added.

2003-03-05 21:05 +0000 [r1655-1657]  robert:

	* Added osgText::String implementation to better handle decoding of
	  encoded text.

	* Added implicit cast to T* to ref_ptr<>.

	* Made the State::setInterleavedArrays method use a const GLvoid*.

2003-03-05 20:18 +0000 [r1654]  robert:

	* Fix for non standard compiliant Forte compilers.

2003-03-05 19:31 +0000 [r1653]  don:

	  different font sizes better and plugin removal safely.

2003-03-04 09:08 +0000 [r1642]  robert:

	* Renamed "libunfreetype.lib" to "freetype.lib"

2003-03-03 22:47 +0000 [r1641]  robert:

	* Added examples/osghud - a osgProducer port of the old osghud
	  demo.

2003-03-03 22:18 +0000 [r1640]  robert:

	* Updates osghud demo. Compile fixes for VisualStudio6.0 because

	* Added search path to osgText::readFontFile.

2003-03-03 16:12 +0000 [r1635]  robert:

	* Changed the ownership of Glyph's so that GlyphTexture's own a
	  reference to Glyph's as well as Font's so keeping the Font valid
	  even after the Font itself has been desctructed.

2003-03-03 15:36 +0000 [r1634]  robert:

	* Fixes to osgText for default parameter.

	* Added using namespace Producer to get round scoping issues
	  associated with trying to support VS6 and the rest of the
	  compiler world.

2003-02-25 12:28 +0000 [r1625]  robert:

	* Renamed osgProducer::CameraGroup and SceneHandler to
	  OsgCameraGroup and OsgSceneHandler to avoid the namespace bug
	  under VS6. Removed the osgproducer demo (its now been replaced by
	  examples/osgviewer.)

2003-02-25 11:56 +0000 [r1624]  robert:

	* Added osg::Image::AllocationMode enum and associated set/get
	  methods. osg::Image::setImage has also been modified to require
	  the AllocationMode mode to be passed to it so that it knows how
	  to delete the data once the image goes out of scope. Port the
	  image plugins across to specify the new AllocationMode, and
	  converted them across to using new/delete in place of
	  malloc/free.

2003-02-24 12:02 +0000 [r1623]  robert:

	* Implemented an osg::minimum and osg::maximum template functions

	  of std::max.

2003-02-21 20:22 +0000 [r1620]  robert:

	* Added #include<algorithm> to keep OSX build compiling. Reverted
	  the mymax implementation to std::max, hopefully this should be ok
	  now that we have standardised on non native STL under
	  VisualStudio.

2003-02-21 14:05 +0000 [r1619]  robert:

	* Added examples directory, a place for all new OSG demo code.

	  options being classed as unrecognized.

2003-02-19 10:43 +0000 [r1614]  robert:

	* Added keyboard mouse binding usage to the osg::ApplicationUsage
	  and osgGA::GUIEventHandler and its subclasses.

2003-02-18 21:58 +0000 [r1613]  robert:

	* Completed first pass at providing commandline option usage via
	  the new osg::ArgumentPareser and osg::ApplicationUsage classes.
	  The osgproducer demo has been implemented using these new
	  mechansims.

2003-02-18 21:10 +0000 [r1612]  robert:

	* Made the osg::ApplicationUsage forward declared. Added include of
	  ostream to ArgumentParser header.

2003-02-18 19:45 +0000 [r1611]  don:

	* std::cout replaced cout

2003-02-18 16:36 +0000 [r1610]  robert:

	  traversal no longer using reference counting of statesets. Moved
	  last uint reference over to unsigned int.

2003-02-14 22:32 +0000 [r1604]  robert:

	* Moved osghanglide back to pure osgGLUT based, removing
	  osgProducer pathways.

2003-02-14 20:27 +0000 [r1603]  robert:

	* More work on uint -> unsigned int.

	  etc. Changed any reference to these in the distribution across to
	  using unsigned char, unsigned short etc. This has been done to
	  keep the OSG code more opaque to what types are.

2003-02-12 14:39 +0000 [r1596]  robert:

	* Merged linkage changes from Duncan Cavens to help the OSG osgtext

	* From Tom Jolley: I was converting a pfb file to osg and had
	  trouble with a missing image library. I added -all in front of
	  -limage where PFLIBS is defined in Make/makedefs to solve my
	  problem.

2003-02-11 15:54 +0000 [r1591]  robert:

	  ps" to enable it.

2003-02-11 12:37 +0000 [r1590]  robert:

	* Clean up of the logo demo.

2003-02-10 22:15 +0000 [r1589]  don:

	  osgProducer::CameraGroup::getTopMostSceneData() convinience
	  method.

2003-01-30 01:31 +0000 [r1575]  robert:

	* Changed the setUpViewer so it takes unisigned int to make it
	  easier to do OR'ing of the various enumerates when passing in
	  paramters (avoids a warning).

	* Fixed the formating of the Matrix output.

	* Added an #ifdef check around the glutSpecialUpFunc to help
	  compile unde old version of GLUT.

2003-01-24 09:11 +0000 [r1554]  robert:

	* Fix for impostors bug where image insert were visible, this was
	  down to a double call to RenderStage::drawPreRenderStage(). The
	  call to it in RenderStage inside the draw() method has been
	  removed, leaving on the call in SceneView.

2003-01-23 22:12 +0000 [r1553]  robert:

	* Changed the template insert(,,) method for a std::copy()

	* Added a couple more #defines for the texture cube maps that one
	  can use.

	* Added support for a -c option.

	* Changed the implementation of the texture objects and display
	  list to delete caches so that they use a std::vector<> swap on
	  the internal data structures when ready to delete to minimize the
	  amount of time that a race condition condition can happen.

2003-01-22 20:48 +0000 [r1540]  robert:

	* Vertex program update from Brede.

2003-01-22 12:25 +0000 [r1533]  robert:

	* Changed the decal=true setting to decal=false to make sure that
	  textured models come out lit ok. The makes the assumption that
	  colour values on the objects and realistic, if they arn't then
	  decal texture can produce better results..

2003-01-22 12:06 +0000 [r1532]  robert:

	* Fixed an Optimizer crash where if the top most node of a model
	  was a static transform it would crash when this root was deleted.

	  copy to image and then copy to texture, as the later was no
	  longer working due to texture->apply ordering.

2003-01-21 16:02 +0000 [r1527]  robert:

	* Added gaurds around alpha function value to catch erroneous
	  values before they are passed on to the OSG.

2003-01-21 13:22 +0000 [r1526]  robert:

	* Made a new osgproducer demo based on the new osgProducer::Viewer
	  class. Kept the old camera group version around for future
	  reference.

	  compile implementation, such as used by text.

2003-01-20 20:33 +0000 [r1522]  robert:

	* Improvements to osgProducer lib, in particular adding a mutex
	  lock to the init() call in SceneView to prevent init running
	  multi-threaded.

2003-01-20 20:28 +0000 [r1521]  robert:

	* Improvements to the handling of multiple graphics contexts. Still
	  needs alot of work, but at least it isn't crashes in trivial
	  cases right now.

2003-01-20 14:08 +0000 [r1519-1520]  robert:

	* Removed the ReaderWriterFLY.cpp for the project as its no longer
	  used.

	* Removed the ReaderWriterFLY demo since it was causing OSX builds
	  to crash when running the osghangglide demo.

2003-01-20 12:41 +0000 [r1517-1518]  robert:

	* Added the new standard copyright notice.

	* Added the OpenSceneGraph Public License which is a based on the

	  USE_DEFAULT_COLOR defines respectively.

2003-01-20 10:41 +0000 [r1512]  robert:

	* Updates from Pavel. 1. Storing color of geometry in ColorArray
	  e.g. its don't work when lighting off. 2. Detecting of alpha
	  channel and automatically enabling blending.

2003-01-20 09:56 +0000 [r1511]  robert:

	* Update the ReaderWriterATTR file so that it used the definitions
	  that Joseph Steel obtained from MPI. Removed the unique child
	  check from the flt::PrimRecord and osg::Group, this allows more
	  flexibility when specifing nodes, and is faster..

2003-01-20 09:09 +0000 [r1510]  robert:

	* From Ruben, updates to the IV/VRML1 loader to handler large
	  datasets.

	* Updates to osgProducer, moving the implementation of CameraGroup
	  and SceneHandler into the source directory.

2003-01-19 15:28 +0000 [r1508]  robert:

	* Added osg::State::dirtyAllModes() and dirtyAllAttributes()
	  methods.

2003-01-18 22:07 +0000 [r1507]  robert:

	* Improvements to the osgProducer lib to better handle Producer's
	  normalized coord system. Addition of ReadCameraConfigFile and
	  WriteCameraConfigFile as a tempory measure for implementing local
	  a C++ read/write of the Producer::CameraConfig, this will be
	  removed once these implementations or similar have been moved to
	  Producer.

2003-01-18 10:17 +0000 [r1506]  robert:

	* Updated the KeyboardMouseCallback so this it takes into account
	  the the new passiveMouseMotion support in Producer.

2003-01-18 09:44 +0000 [r1505]  robert:

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, Fix for IRIX build, adding typename into

	  disabling the daft VisualStudio warnings.

2003-01-15 20:50 +0000 [r1487]  robert:

	* Made the osgDB::ParamterOutput class so that it is purely defined
	  in terms of the header, and therefore not requiring to be
	  exported. Updated the MUSE_READ_ME.txt to include mention of
	  syntax highlighting.

2003-01-15 19:23 +0000 [r1486]  robert:

2003-01-14 14:21 +0000 [r1477]  robert:

	* Added an compile in option of applying the matrices before state
	  in the RenderLeaf apply method. This order is intended to help
	  support of vertex programming, but unfortunately breaks the

	  protected to ensure that they arn't created on the stack
	  inappropriately. Split the implemention of Matrix up so that it
	  is a simple no referenced counted class and can be safefly
	  created on the stack. To support referenced counting a seperate
	  subclass now exists, this is RefMatrix which inherits from both
	  Matrix and Object.

2003-01-09 18:41 +0000 [r1462]  robert:

	* Moved the include/osgTXP back into src/osgPlugins/txp as a
	  seperate include directory is no longer required. Removed the
	  osgtxp demo as it is no longer required.

2002-12-17 15:41 +0000 [r1428]  robert:

	  framework. Have added a very simple unit test to Vec3.cpp, which
	  are optionally compiled in with the OSG_COMPILE_UNIT_TESTS
	  define, which is only currently defined in debug builds under
	  unix. It should be fine to add it in under Windows project files
	  as well. Finally, a new demo app osgunittests runs the tests and
	  reports success or failure of the tests.

2002-08-27 21:01 +0000 [r1095]  robert:

	* Commented out the #define TEXTURE_USE_DEPRECATED_API from

	* From Marco, fix to include/GL to clean up warnigns in Windows
	  builds.

2002-08-27 10:06 +0000 [r1088]  robert:

	  and have added osgtexture1D demo which currently is simply copy
	  of osgtexture2D. I will be modifying it to do 1D texturing next.
	  Fixed a bug in osg::Texture3D relating to checking of existance
	  of texturing. Merged some fixes to the pfb loader from Ulrich
	  Hertlein.

	  compile path for VS7 compilation.

2002-08-26 12:34 +0000 [r1083]  robert:

	  account of this.

2002-08-22 08:14 +0000 [r1068]  robert:

	* Fixed the osg::Transform::coompute*() methods so the were using

	  exact opposite from what they should have been doing.

2002-08-21 20:42 +0000 [r1067]  robert:

	* From Stephan Huber, "I found a small bug in QTtexture.c: the code
	  fails, when the image-files don't reside on the boot-partition. I
	  replaced the offending function by a cleaner one.".

2002-08-20 22:43 +0000 [r1066]  robert:

	* Moved the include<osg/GLExtensions> from the State header into

	  suppot for these new parameters to the .osg plugin.

2002-08-20 08:14 +0000 [r1057]  robert:

	* Reordered the string comparions so that DEBUG_INFO comes before
	  INFO, since the find op will find INFO in a DEBUG_INFO string,
	  and hence report the wrong notify level.

2002-08-19 19:53 +0000 [r1056]  robert:

	* Added default values to the TexEnvCombine constructor.

2002-08-19 15:14 +0000 [r1055]  robert:

	  subsequent ones to get the VisualStudio compiler working once
	  more.

2002-08-18 14:42 +0000 [r1051]  robert:

	* Added DOFTransform, MatrixTransform and PositionAttitudeTransform
	  to NodeVisitor. Added
	  osg::Matrix/Quat::makeRotate(angle1,axis1,angle2,axis2,angle3,axis3)
	  and osg::Matrix::rotate(angle1,axis1,angle2,axis2,angle3,axis3)
	  method. Made osg::Matrix/Quat::makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) and
	  osg::Matrix::rotate(heading,pitch,roll) all deprecated API. Fixed
	  the Quat*Quat & Quat*=Quat multiplication methods so that they
	  multiplied in the correct order - they were reversed originally
	  due to the Quat code being based on code example which used the
	  v' = M v ordering, rather than the OSG's v' = v M ordering.

2002-08-18 11:16 +0000 [r1050]  robert:

	  texture subloading more flexible.

2002-08-16 10:56 +0000 [r1046]  robert:

	* Fixes from Ulrich Hertlein to get the pfb plugin compiling with

	  osglight demo to show it action.

2002-08-13 13:22 +0000 [r1035]  robert:

	* Made improvements to osg::AnimationPath, added
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform::AnimationPathCallback which us an
	  app callback which uses an AnimationPath to specify the new
	  positions of the transform. Added AnimationPath code to osglight
	  to animate the positional light. Added
	  CullVisitor::setCullingMode() code into SceneView so that
	  SceneView's CullingMode is now properly passed onto CullVisitor.
	  Note, this work had been done before, but must has been lost in a
	  merge. Umm...

2002-08-13 09:35 +0000 [r1034]  robert:

	* Fixed uninitialized _sortMode.

2002-08-12 17:40 +0000 [r1033]  robert:

	* Added new s/getPivotPoint() support to
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform. Modified the osglight demo to use
	  an AppCallback and a PositionAttitudeTransform to animate the

2002-08-12 13:42 +0000 [r1032]  robert:

	* Updates to DOFTransform so that its overrides the traverse() and
	  compute*() methods rather than depending upon callbacks for
	  animating and compute matrices. Merged the put/inverseput code
	  between Sasa's and Ferndinand's DOF code. From Bora Utka, Added
	  support to osg::Sequence/OpenFlight AnimNode to the flt plugin.

	* Removed dependency of the new osg::DOFTransform and osg::Sequence
	  Node's on osgUtil by implementing a NodeVisitor::VisitorType
	  enum, and associated g/setVisitorType. This allows callbacks to
	  querry the visitor/traversal type without doing down cast's to
	  specific visitor subclasses such as
	  osgUtil::AppVisitor/CullVisitor.

2002-08-11 10:32 +0000 [r1029]  robert:

	* Temporarily commented out the flat staic transforms visitor since

	  Nikolaus Hanekamp.

2002-08-08 11:27 +0000 [r1021]  robert:

	* Changed the Geometry::setVertexArray and GeoSet::setCoords so
	  that they call dirtyBound() instead of reseting the local bound
	  flag, this ensures the updates are propagated upwards through
	  into the parents.

2002-08-08 11:01 +0000 [r1020]  robert:

	* Fixed the shininess factor in 3ds plugin.

2002-08-07 15:52 +0000 [r1019]  robert:

	* Changed the support for anisotropic filtering in osg::Texture so
	  that it is now controlled via the setMaxAnisotropy(float) method,
	  and is set up independently for the mag filter mode, which it
	  previously was done.

2002-08-07 10:10 +0000 [r1017-1018]  robert:

	* Renamed osgsequence.cpp to osgsequence.dsp, as it was clearly a
	  typo...

	* Fixed type of DOFTransform.cpp

2002-08-06 17:07 +0000 [r1016]  robert:

	* Added shells for DOFTransform and PositionAttitudeTransform to
	  the .osg loader, still need to fill in the saving and loading of
	  paramters. Went through the distribution remove old API usage.

2002-08-06 10:37 +0000 [r1015]  robert:

	* Changed the default value of _animationOn to true.

2002-08-06 10:07 +0000 [r1014]  robert:

	* Fixed typo in comment.

2002-08-06 10:04 +0000 [r1013]  robert:

	  into the osgreflect demo so that toggling texturing on or off
	  won't affect the mirror planes texturing.

2002-08-05 12:52 +0000 [r1009]  robert:

	* Fixed compile errors under IRIX.

2002-08-05 12:40 +0000 [r1008]  robert:

	* Added support to StateAttribute/State to support PROTECTED flag
	  for modes and attributes so that they cannot be overriden from
	  above via the OVERRIDE flag. This is useful for things like
	  manipulators that have handles display in the scene, you might
	  want to prevent their state being affected by other overriding of
	  light, wireframe modes etc.

2002-08-04 21:11 +0000 [r1007]  robert:

	* Fix to iv/vrml loader so that it correctly passes back the right
	  ReadResult and checks the validity of the file extension being
	  passed to the plugin. Removed main.cpp * .h moving all its
	  functionality into readerwriter.cpp.

2002-08-04 20:51 +0000 [r1006]  robert:

	  file to load is not recognised. Also add check for LWO2 loading
	  so that it returns FILE_NOT_HANDLED message correctly.

2002-08-04 20:34 +0000 [r1005]  robert:

	* Added Sequence.cpp to osg plugin workspace file.

2002-08-03 19:37 +0000 [r1003]  robert:

	* Changed the copy constructor of for _light mem var to use a
	  dynamic_cast<StateAttribute*>.

2002-08-03 18:11 +0000 [r1002]  robert:

	* Integrated Ulrich Hertlien's osg::Sequence node, and osgsequence
	  demo, and support for osg::Sequence in the pfb loader.

2002-08-03 18:03 +0000 [r1001]  robert:

	* Changed the range max and min members variables to maximum and
	  minimum to prevent collision with windows min and max macros.

	* Added support for a sort callback in RenderBin.

	* Fixed comments.

2002-08-03 16:37 +0000 [r998]  robert:

	* Added cout's of the view frustum to the aid debugging, these
	  cout's are now commented out, and are just left in so that they
	  may be used to double check things in future.

2002-08-02 19:11 +0000 [r997]  robert:

	* Fix for Win32 build

2002-08-02 15:14 +0000 [r996]  robert:

	* Added missing _nodePath.clear() and _segHitList.clear() to
	  InteresectVisitor::reset().

2002-07-31 15:16 +0000 [r995]  robert:

	* Updates to iv/vrml loader from Ruben.

2002-07-30 10:08 +0000 [r994]  robert:

	  allow the user to control which parts on an image are subloaded
	  from, and how big the initial texture is.

	* Checked in Pavel's updates for non texured surfaces.

2002-07-28 21:25 +0000 [r988]  robert:

	* Added set/getUnrefImageOnApply() methods and associated flag and
	  code in Texture::apply() to set the _image to 0 on apply. Note,
	  this will only work when you have a single graphics context, as
	  with multiple graphics contexts one can't delete the image after
	  the first apply, as there will be more than one texture object to
	  update.

2002-07-28 21:15 +0000 [r987]  robert:

	* Checked in Marco's commented out #defines/rejigged struct names
	  to get things compiling under Windows, will need to check this in
	  future as it may change with regeneration of parser files with
	  lex/yacc.

	* Fix for colors in old flt models from Brede.

2002-07-25 14:42 +0000 [r967]  robert:

	* Removed double quotes from around the : DBGF = -g
	  -DOSG_USE_MEMORY_MANAGER As this was breaking the build.

	* Added the missing _primtives from the copy constructor list.

	* Added fog toggling to Viewer.cpp, 'y' reduces fog density, 'Y'
	  increases fog density.

2002-07-23 15:01 +0000 [r962]  robert:

	* Mods for HP-UX port.

2002-07-23 14:35 +0000 [r961]  robert:

	* Added mode checking into StateSet to try and catch non texture
	  OpenGL modes which have been applied to the texture modes and
	  visa-versa.

2002-07-23 13:30 +0000 [r960]  robert:

	* Support added for Gnu C++ under Solaris.

2002-07-23 10:48 +0000 [r959]  robert:

	* Checked in Tino Schwarze's port to HP-UX.

2002-07-22 16:01 +0000 [r958]  robert:

	* Updates to osgParticle form Macro.

2002-07-22 13:05 +0000 [r957]  robert:

	* Merged changed to osgParticle from Macro, these add the ability
	  to orientate the particles to predefined axis.

	  OSG_MM_CHECK_FOR_UNINITIALIZED

2002-07-20 18:27 +0000 [r945]  robert:

	* Umm... these should have already been commited, not sure why cvs

	  ChangeLog and NEWS for the release.

2002-07-19 15:03 +0000 [r939]  robert:

	* Removed debugging cout's.

2002-07-19 14:52 +0000 [r938]  robert:

	* Updated Doyxgen files.

2002-07-19 14:19 +0000 [r937]  robert:

	* Added primitve merging into the osg::Geometry optimizer.

2002-07-19 12:51 +0000 [r935]  robert:

	* Removed the cow.osg paramter for the osgparticle cow.osg in the
	  test scripts

2002-07-19 10:18 +0000 [r934]  robert:

	* Added MatrixTransform.cpp.

2002-07-19 09:10 +0000 [r933]  robert:

	* Changed the "reflect.rgb" path to "Images/reflect.rgb" to the
	  help find the file required.

2002-07-18 22:35 +0000 [r931-932]  robert:

	* Updates NEWS file for 0.9.0 release. Added default computeBound()
	  implementation to osg::Drawable which uses a PrimtiveFunctor to
	  compute the bounding box in a generic way, that will work for all
	  Drawable subclasses that implement the accept(PrimitiveFunctor&).

	* Added osgoccluder to test scripts.

2002-07-18 19:54 +0000 [r929-930]  robert:

	* Moved the 't' operation on texture modes across to use the new
	  StateSet::setTextureMode methods, this enables 't' to work once
	  more!

	* Updated docs ready for the release.

2002-07-18 19:41 +0000 [r928]  robert:

	* Moved get/setUserData from osg::Node into its superclass
	  osg::Object to allow other subclasses to add their own custom
	  data.

2002-07-18 15:36 +0000 [r927]  robert:

	* Rewrote the osg::Drawable::AttributeFunctor and PrimtiveFunctor
	  to make them more consistent with each other. This does mean an
	  API change, so dependanct code in the OSG has been updated
	  accordingly.

2002-07-18 15:28 +0000 [r926]  robert:

	* From Randall Hopper, warning fixes for IRIX.

2002-07-18 15:25 +0000 [r925]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen, fix the TexturePaletteRecord::endian() to
	  handle old flt versions (11, 12 & 13).

2002-07-18 14:29 +0000 [r924]  robert:

	* From Brede Johansen "I have found one bug in the
	  ConvertFromFLT::visitFace() function. In the early days of the
	  Flight format, before the LightPoint record existed they used
	  face records with a light (-point) attribute."

2002-07-18 14:20 +0000 [r923]  robert:

	* Rewrote osg:Statistics so that it is PrimitiveFunctor as is now
	  completely decoupled from osg::Drawable. The Drawable::getStats()
	  virtual method no longer exists. Updated the Viewer to use the
	  osg::Statistics incarnation and reformated stats to clean it up.

2002-07-18 10:55 +0000 [r922]  robert:

	* Added code into osg::LightSource so it correctly computes its
	  bounding sphere, taking into account any subgraph below, and the
	  light itself if it is not a infinite light.

2002-07-18 10:49 +0000 [r921]  robert:

	* Updated the test scripts to include cube mapping example and
	  osglight demo.

2002-07-18 10:41 +0000 [r920]  robert:

	* Removed repeated return transform in the visitDOF method.

2002-07-18 10:38 +0000 [r919]  robert:

	* Added support for .sgi alias extension to the .rgb plugin.

2002-07-18 10:06 +0000 [r918]  robert:

	* Fixed warnings.

2002-07-18 09:55 +0000 [r917]  robert:

	* Converted the osg::Material::set/getShininess option to use the
	  standard OpenGL range of 0.0 to 128.0 instead of the previous
	  normalised shiniess range. This brings it inline with the way the
	  rest of the OSG uses a 1 to 1 mapping to OpenGL. Converted the
	  various loaders to use the new range, which is almost all cases
	  was simply removing the /128.0f which was required before!

2002-07-18 09:17 +0000 [r916]  robert:

	* Added const to LessGeometry functor to fix Win32 build.

2002-07-18 00:55 +0000 [r914-915]  robert:

	* Fixed spelling mistake.

	* Various fixes to the flt loader, and knock on changes to the
	  osgUtil::Optimizer to better support removal of seperate
	  osg::Geometry instances where they share the same state and
	  bindings.

2002-07-17 16:24 +0000 [r913]  robert:

	* Changed from a -> to *() when using the object pointed to by a
	  reverse iterator, to fix problems with build under VS6/STLport.

2002-07-17 12:21 +0000 [r912]  robert:

	* Fix for Win32 build.

2002-07-17 10:00 +0000 [r911]  robert:

	* Several items of work related to adding a manual creation of
	  occluders option to the osgoccluder demo. First the osgGA classes
	  have been generalised a little to better support new
	  GUIEventHandler subclasses. Second osgGLUT has a new option for
	  registering a user defined event handler, the allows the
	  application to add externally extra options to the osgGLUT
	  viewer. Third, the osgoccluder demo now works in two modes. The
	  original create four occluder sides to wrap an loaded model, the
	  second an interactive mode which allows the users to add
	  occluders to the model by pointing to points and pressing 'a' to
	  add a point, the 'e' to end the occluder polygon, polygons must
	  be convex, planer and be defined in an anitclockwise order. To
	  start the osgoccluder in this mode one simple runs it with the
	  '-c' option. Run osgoccluder with no parameter to get a list of
	  options.

2002-07-16 20:07 +0000 [r910]  robert:

	* Updated docs and added osgGA

2002-07-16 19:21 +0000 [r907-909]  robert:

	* Updates from Bob Kuehne and Kristopher Bixler to remove the fink
	  dependency from the MacOSX build.

	* Fix to DOF Record from Sasa Bistrovic

2002-07-16 18:56 +0000 [r906]  robert:

	* Removed repeat line from Makefile.

2002-07-16 15:43 +0000 [r905]  robert:

	* Bumped up the version numbers to 0.9.0 to reflect the upcomming
	  release.

2002-07-16 15:28 +0000 [r904]  robert:

	* Rewrote the apply_imp template method so that it takes an
	  initialization paramater.

2002-07-16 15:13 +0000 [r902-903]  robert:

	* Fixes for MacOSX build from Bob Kuehne.

	* Added the beginings of an osglight demo.

2002-07-16 11:33 +0000 [r901]  robert:

	* Added TextureCubeMap.cpp to the .osg plugin Makefile.

2002-07-16 10:20 +0000 [r900]  robert:

	* Fixed the new TemplateArray desctructor.

2002-07-16 10:16 +0000 [r899]  robert:

	* Added protected destrcutor to TemplateArray.

2002-07-15 22:23 +0000 [r898]  robert:

	* Added support to osgUtil::Tesselator to insert extra vertices and
	  other attributes into an osg::Geometry node. Uses the new
	  osg::ArrayVisitor. Converted the osg plugin Geometry support to
	  use the new UByte4 class.

2002-07-15 22:18 +0000 [r897]  robert:

	* Added osg::UByte4 class, which can be used to represent packed
	  colors. Changed osg::UByte4Array across to use the new
	  osg::UByte4 class rather than a GLuint as do previously. Cleaned
	  up some of the paramters in osg::Vec4.

2002-07-15 13:39 +0000 [r896]  robert:

	* Removed the second texture from the prerender demo so as not over
	  complicate the final image.

2002-07-15 13:20 +0000 [r895]  robert:

	* Fixed the orientation of the osgreflect demo so that the
	  reflection plane is orientated towards the viewer. Changed the
	  lightmodel ambient level to 0.1,0.1,0.1 instead of 0.0, so that a
	  small amount of ambient lighting is available to render back
	  surfaces. The osgreflect and osgprerender suffered unexpected
	  behaviors because of no lighting on the backfaces.

2002-07-15 13:14 +0000 [r893-894]  robert:

	* Added a MatrixTransform to tilt the osgreflect demo so that the
	  reflection plane is seen clearly.

	* Fixed the optimization of the orientation conversion.

2002-07-15 11:44 +0000 [r892]  robert:

	* Fixed memory leak in FieldReaderIterator.cpp. Updated the
	  Make/osgtests.bat and Make/debugtests.bat scripts.

2002-07-15 10:53 +0000 [r890-891]  robert:

	* Renamed hangglide to osghangglide

	* Removed the old hangglide directory.

2002-07-15 10:45 +0000 [r888-889]  robert:

	* Renamed osghangglide demo.

	* Renamed the hangglide demo osghangglide to make it consistent
	  with the rest of the demos.

2002-07-15 10:03 +0000 [r887]  robert:

	* Added State::disableTexCoordPointersAboveAndIncluding( unit )
	  method so that all unsed texture units can be turned off simply
	  within Drawables such as Geometry and GeoSet. This can be used to
	  prevent bleed of arrays from one object to the next - which can
	  cause crashes.

2002-07-15 04:42 +0000 [r886]  don:

	* Changes for Sunos

2002-07-14 21:49 +0000 [r885]  don:

	  bin.

2002-07-14 16:26 +0000 [r881]  robert:

	* Fixed computeNearFar bug in CullVisitor::apply(Billboard&).

2002-07-14 10:46 +0000 [r880]  robert:

	* Fixes to read/write of MatrixTransform/Transform.

2002-07-14 08:35 +0000 [r879]  robert:

	* Copy and Paste bug where an for() loop was repeated within
	  itself, which was introduced when moving across to use
	  osg::Geometry.

2002-07-13 21:17 +0000 [r878]  robert:

	* Fixed various warnings which were appearing under MacOSX.

2002-07-13 20:31 +0000 [r877]  robert:

	* Conveted GeoSet to use the new state::set*Pointer/disable*Pointer
	  methods to keep the current state valid.

2002-07-13 14:16 +0000 [r876]  robert:

	* Support added for multitextured TXP files, sent in by Boris
	  Bralo.

2002-07-13 02:46 +0000 [r875]  don:

	* put a typedef in public area of class for sun compilers

2002-07-12 21:45 +0000 [r872-874]  robert:

	* Added missing MatrixTransform.cpp file

	* added glutInit to osgparticle demo to fix crash under MacOSX.

	* Added second texture to osgprerender demo to test out
	  multitexture in osg::Geometry, it works!!

2002-07-12 21:08 +0000 [r871]  robert:

	* Added MatrixTransform header and source.

2002-07-12 19:50 +0000 [r870]  robert:

	* Changed the osgmultitexture demo so that it uses a TexEnv::BLEND
	  mode with a colour. This lightens the resultant models.

2002-07-12 18:14 +0000 [r868-869]  robert:

	* Added using namespace osgUtil to get round IRIX/Windows compiler
	  differences.

	* Ported distribution across to use the new osg::MatrixTransform
	  and osg::BlendFunc class instead of osg::Transform and
	  osg::Transparancy respectively.

2002-07-12 14:25 +0000 [r867]  robert:

	* Have added a #define USE_DEPRECATED_API to include/osg/Export,
	  and various osg header and source files to optional compile in
	  deprecated parts of the OSG API. Have renamed osg::Transparency
	  osg::BlendFunc to bring it in line with the rest of the OSG's
	  StateAttribute classes which are named after their OpenGL
	  counterparts. include/osg/Transparency still exists and is simply
	  a typedef to BlendFunc and is enclosed in a #ifdef
	  USE_DEPRECTATED_API block. The matrix methods in the
	  osg::Transform class have been moved/replicated in a
	  osg::MatrixTransform sublcass from osg::Transform. The old matrix
	  functionality is still present in the osg::Transform class but is
	  guard by #ifdef USG_DEPRECATED_API blocks. One should now think
	  of osg::Transform as being a Transform Node base class.
	  MatrixTransform has all the functionality of the original
	  Transform class, so should be used instead.

2002-07-12 13:00 +0000 [r866]  robert:

	* Fix, sent in by Macro Jez, to the set of the camera with the
	  computed near and far plane, so that it is only updated when
	  _computeNearFar != CullVisitor::DO_NOT_COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR.

2002-07-12 10:30 +0000 [r865]  robert:

	* Added blend color to osg::TexEnv

	* Addition of RoadRecords from Yefei He.

2002-07-11 23:30 +0000 [r862]  don:

	* added -lpthread to the link line for Linux builds. Seems Red Hat
	  7.3 turns up undefined symbols without it.

2002-07-11 21:08 +0000 [r861]  robert:

	* Fixes for Win32 build

	  osgmultitexture demo which adds as spherical environment map
	  using texture 1 to any model.

2002-07-11 14:32 +0000 [r857]  robert:

	* Moved the code referencing osg::BoundingBox::isValid() and
	  osg::BoundingSphere::isValid() across to use the valid() methods,
	  the later being more consitent with other classes such as
	  osg::ref_ptr<>.

2002-07-11 12:57 +0000 [r856]  robert:

	* Fixes for win32 build

2002-07-11 11:08 +0000 [r853]  robert:

	* Fixed the pathname for the osgprerender demo.

2002-07-11 08:28 +0000 [r852]  robert:

	* changed unsigned int/short/char* references to
	  GLuint,GLushort,GLubyte respectively.

2002-07-10 22:38 +0000 [r851]  robert:

	* Updates for new use of GLushort instead of osg::ushort in GeoSet
	  index pointer.

2002-07-10 22:33 +0000 [r850]  robert:

	* Tidied up the types in osg::GeoSet so that the index pointers use
	  GLushort and GLuint to get round compile issues under MacOSX.

2002-07-10 20:30 +0000 [r849]  robert:

	* Updates to osg::Drawable::AppCallback and osgprerender demo.

	* Ported all the demos and loaders across to use the new
	  multitexturing API.

2002-07-10 09:32 +0000 [r844]  robert:

	* Added Yefei He's RoadRecords to the flt loader, these records
	  will be ignored by the loader, but will allow the loader to skip
	  over them and continue reading the rest of the file correctly.

2002-07-10 09:14 +0000 [r843]  robert:

	* Updates from Macro to support the new multitexture API, and
	  improve bounding box computation.

	  unix file endings.

2002-07-07 14:40 +0000 [r828]  robert:

	* Work on supporting multitexturing in
	  State/StateSet/StateAttribute/Geoemtry.

	* Added osgUtil dependency to the flt project.

2002-07-02 19:53 +0000 [r820]  robert:

	* Reimplemted the osgUtil::SceneView::setCalcNearFar()
	  functionality to bring it inline with the CullStack/CullVisitor
	  implementation. Also added the setSmallFeatureCullingPixelSize()
	  method and wired them up inside SceneView.cpp so they set the
	  corresponding CullVisitor paramters. Intergrated pfImage copying
	  change in the Performer plugin, submission sent in by Ulrich
	  Hertlein

2002-07-02 15:01 +0000 [r819]  don:

	* -n32 and -64 entries were reversed in makedefs

	  when cull Callbacks require the contextID for doing operations on
	  texture objects, for example. Modified CullVisitor SceneView and
	  Drawable

2002-07-01 14:40 +0000 [r816]  don:

2002-06-28 22:42 +0000 [r814]  robert:

	* Rewrote the osgUtil::Tesselator so that it is easier to use, and
	  can also easily retesselate osg::Primitive::POLYGONS found in
	  Geometry objects. Added calls to the tesselate to the lwo and flt
	  loaders.

2002-06-28 20:54 +0000 [r813]  robert:

	* A couple fixes to remove Performer runtime warnings.

2002-06-28 16:25 +0000 [r812]  robert:

	* Fixes from Ulrich Hertlein to build of pfb plugin. Small mods to
	  these by Robert.

2002-06-28 08:36 +0000 [r808]  robert:

	* Change =0 to osg::Vec2Array::iterator() in .obj loader to get
	  round warnings under gcc3.0.x

2002-06-27 20:29 +0000 [r807]  robert:

	* Ported the flt plugin across to use osg::Geometry, it still uses
	  a GeoSet internally, and I will remove this after some futher
	  work.

2002-06-27 15:18 +0000 [r806]  robert:

	* Added SG_EXPORT which was missing.

2002-06-27 13:15 +0000 [r805]  robert:

	* Moved the AttributeArray and Primitive classes into their own
	  header and source files.

2002-06-27 09:56 +0000 [r803]  robert:

	* Removed the test aginst a iterator as a bool.

2002-06-26 21:11 +0000 [r800-802]  robert:

	* Added comment to explain #ifdefs for member templates.

	* Added #idef to Export to add check for support for member
	  templates.

	* Ported LWO loader across to use osg::Geometry. Work not quite
	  complete, as we need to retesselate any concave polygons that can
	  exists in these datasets.

2002-06-26 17:48 +0000 [r799]  robert:

	* Added templated constructor to TemplateArray & DrawElements
	  template to handle VisualStudio7.0 build. Ported 3DS across to
	  use osg::Geometry instead of osg::GeoSet.

2002-06-26 14:34 +0000 [r798]  robert:

	* Ported pfb, txp and obj loaders across to use osg::Geometry.

2002-06-26 10:28 +0000 [r797]  robert:

	* Ported various demos and support classes over to use the new
	  osg::Geometry class thus removing dependancy on osg::Geoset from
	  most of the OSG, only loaders left to port now.

2002-06-25 20:47 +0000 [r796]  robert:

	* Fixes for Cygwin build from Norman Vine.

2002-06-25 20:36 +0000 [r795]  robert:

	* Fix to Quat::slerp so that it interpolates along the shortest
	  path.

2002-06-25 20:27 +0000 [r794]  robert:

	* Added osg::Drawable::PrimitiveFunctor and TriangleFunctor
	  subclass for querrying the primitive data inside Drawables. Moved
	  various support classes over from being osg::GeoSet based to
	  osg::Geometry based.

2002-06-24 21:44 +0000 [r793]  robert:

	* Fixed osgText::Text::DrawModeType::ALIGNEMENT spelling mistake,
	  now is ALIGNMENT.

2002-06-24 21:37 +0000 [r792]  robert:

	* Checked in .osg support for the new osg::Geometry class.

2002-06-24 12:53 +0000 [r791]  robert:

	* Added required std:: to front of endl to fix Win32 build.

2002-06-23 21:43 +0000 [r790]  robert:

	* Added conversion to osg::GeoSet::converToGeometry() utility to
	  help the migration to and testing of the new osg::Geometry class.

2002-06-22 15:46 +0000 [r789]  robert:

	* Compile Fixes for Win32.

	* Added new osggeometry demo to test the work on the new
	  osg::Geometry Drawable.

2002-06-21 15:14 +0000 [r786]  robert:

	* Bug fix to the size calculation of bmp images, changed both the
	  reading and writing of images.

2002-06-21 07:48 +0000 [r785]  robert:

	* Fixed constructor for TemplateArray(const TemplateArray& t,const
	  CopyOp& copyop).

2002-06-20 19:54 +0000 [r784]  robert:

	* Addd new experimental osg::Geometry Drawable which will
	  eventually replace GeoSet. Currently doesn't draw anything, and
	  is very much in the early design stages.

2002-06-20 18:17 +0000 [r783]  robert:

	* Mods to MemoryManager to make the optimized build produce dummy
	  implementations for all the public functions found in the header,
	  this should prevent problems when not compiling in the
	  MemoryManager under IRIX 64 build.

2002-06-19 20:38 +0000 [r782]  robert:

	* Fixed incorrect naming of ConvexPlanerOccluder.

2002-06-19 18:45 +0000 [r781]  robert:

	* Added support for reading the new OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE
	  environmental variable inside the
	  osg::Image::ensureValidSizeForTexturing() method. The smallest of
	  GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE and OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE is used for the
	  final max texture size. This new env. var. allows users to
	  deliberate cap the size of their textures so they can test
	  whether their models are limited by texture memory. If reducing
	  the max texture size increases performance then you are limited
	  by texture memory!

2002-06-19 16:06 +0000 [r780]  robert:

	* Added support for reading and writing OccluderNode's to the .osg
	  file format.

2002-06-19 15:18 +0000 [r779]  robert:

	* Added computation of the bounding volume of osg::OccluderNodes.
	  Added support for
	  osg::BoundingSphere::expandBy*(osg::BoundingBox) and have added
	  osg::BoundingSphere/Box::valid() which deprecates isValid(), this
	  is to be more consistent with other classes in the OSG.

2002-06-19 10:19 +0000 [r778]  robert:

	* Added support for occlusion of holes in occluders, and cleaned up
	  the interface to ShadowVolumeOccluders.

2002-06-19 08:34 +0000 [r777]  robert:

	* Changed the osg::LightSource so its Light attribute is now
	  generalised to be a StateAttribute. This allows alternative
	  implementations of Lights other than the standard osg::Light.

2002-06-18 22:35 +0000 [r776]  robert:

	* Added support for occluders occluding other occluders, which
	  helps reduce the number of occluder that will be used in cull
	  traversal to only the ones that will be effective. Note. Holes in
	  occluders arn't handled in this occluder occlusion test, will
	  implement this later.

2002-06-18 10:18 +0000 [r775]  robert:

	* Clean ups for the Windows build.

2002-06-18 09:09 +0000 [r774]  robert:

	* Added the length argument to a std::string argument, under Linux
	  it compiled with the default value npos, under Windows it broke
	  the build, add the npost excpilicity should get round this
	  difference in implementation.

2002-06-17 21:50 +0000 [r773]  robert:

	* Rewrote the FileUtils support for data and library file paths,
	  moving the storage of the path lists into osgDB::Registry, and
	  changed the data structor from a char* to a std::deque. Changed a
	  names of couple of the convinience functions in osgDB/FileUtils
	  to better reflect the two public FilePathList's -
	  DataFilePathList and the LibraryFilePathList. Added support into
	  the osgDB::Registry::readNode/Image/Object methods for pushing
	  and popping the path of the current file being loaded.

2002-06-17 09:10 +0000 [r772]  robert:

	* Fixes to the occluder culling code to properly disable occluders
	  to prevent self occlusion.

2002-06-15 20:57 +0000 [r771]  robert:

	* Fixes for Visual .NET and Mingw builds, and fix MacOSX notify()
	  crash.

2002-06-15 12:14 +0000 [r770]  robert:

	* Added computation of occluders volume scaled relative to the
	  frustum volume, all volumes computed in eye coords.

2002-06-14 16:28 +0000 [r769]  robert:

	* Added computation of the occluders volume, scale it to a ratio of
	  the frustum.

2002-06-14 14:50 +0000 [r768]  robert:

	* Added occluder hole test code into the osgoccluder demo. The code
	  works, but I've commented it out right now as the Geode
	  physically representing the occluder doesn't yet have a hole in
	  it - just a cosmetic thing.

2002-06-14 13:49 +0000 [r767]  robert:

	* Refined the CollectOccluderVisitor so that it checks the subgraph
	  below a node contains occluders before traversing.

2002-06-14 11:27 +0000 [r766]  robert:

	* Improvements to the plane clipping code.

2002-06-14 08:45 +0000 [r765]  robert:

	* Further updates to the occlusion culling code, also adding
	  missing OccludeNode file the .osg plugin.

2002-06-13 23:46 +0000 [r764]  robert:

	* Further work on occlusion culling.

2002-06-13 19:39 +0000 [r763]  don:

	* removed the use of gettimeofday for 32 bit architectures...

2002-06-13 19:34 +0000 [r762]  robert:

	* Added #include <osg/ref_ptr> so that it will compile properly
	  regardless of include order.

2002-06-13 19:10 +0000 [r761]  robert:

	* Added -osgGA to the Makefile list.

2002-06-13 18:27 +0000 [r760]  robert:

	* Merge Randall's changes.

2002-06-13 16:21 +0000 [r759]  robert:

	* Further work on Occlusion Culling. Most of work is complete, just
	  debugging required now.

2002-06-12 16:23 +0000 [r758]  robert:

	* Removed inappropriate inline keyword which was breaking the IRIX
	  build.

	  osgDB::getStrippedName() so that they check for both unix style
	  '/' and windows style '\' slashes in file names.

2002-06-12 13:54 +0000 [r754]  robert:

	* Fix for renaming of ShadowOccluderVolume to ShadowVolumeOccluder.

	* A little more work on Occlusion culling.

2002-06-11 18:41 +0000 [r751]  robert:

	* Checked in Macro Jez's additions to osgText to support .osg IO
	  make it a fully functioning NodeKit. Also reimplement notify() to
	  try an prevent a crash which has been caused by to objects in
	  notify.cpp being initiliazed twice, the second time the auto_ptr
	  holding the dev/null ofstream was being initilized to 0.

2002-06-10 13:50 +0000 [r750]  robert:

	* Added osg::CollectOccludersVisitor which is a helper class for
	  finding active occluder in the view frustum, to be used as pre
	  cull traversal.

2002-06-10 11:21 +0000 [r749]  robert:

	  accumulation of projection, modelview and culling sets, to be
	  used during travesal of the scene graph, such as the cull
	  traversal.

2002-06-09 13:10 +0000 [r748]  robert:

	* Checked in migration from osgUtil based GUIAdapter code to Neil
	  Salter's osgGA (Gui Abstraction). This may break users code, but
	  all it should require to fix the builds should be a change from
	  osgUtil::CameraManipulator (etc) to osgGA::CameraManipulator and
	  include <osgUtil/CameraManipulator (etc) to
	  osgGA/CameraManipulator and the extra dependency of the link
	  line.

2002-06-08 19:58 +0000 [r747]  robert:

	* More more occlusion culling.

2002-06-07 20:03 +0000 [r746]  robert:

	* Added osgoccluder demo, it creates a single quad occluder, but
	  the culling code is not complete yet, so it won't actually do any
	  occlusion culling, the demo is here so I can test the evolving
	  occlusion culling code.

2002-06-07 14:54 +0000 [r745]  don:

	* #ifdefed out cstdlib for irix

2002-06-07 13:57 +0000 [r744]  robert:

	* Added default IntersectVisitor::_hitReportingMode to be

	  in .osg files which have the library::class syntax will
	  automatically invoke the dynamic loading of either a nodekit or
	  database plugin.

2002-06-06 14:00 +0000 [r741]  robert:

	* Fixed crash in loading osg files which have object types which
	  arn't recognized.

	  can be used to replace VisualStudio standard one, this enabled VS
	  to reconginse OSG header files as C++ files.

	* Fixed a bug in the Optimizer::RemoveDuplicateNodesVisitor which
	  was prevent removal of node which could have been removed. Added
	  so extra convinience methods to ClippingVolume and utilized them
	  in the CullVisitor to push and pop only culling planes that are
	  active.

2002-05-22 19:58 +0000 [r705]  don:

	* Fixed spelling error Calander -> Calendar

2002-05-22 12:19 +0000 [r704]  robert:

	  Small changing of order of push/pop of StateSet's in SceneView to
	  clean things up.

2002-05-22 10:04 +0000 [r702]  robert:

	* Changed the public osg::State::applyMode() and applyAttribute
	  methods so that they dirty the associated state, this helps keep
	  the OpenGL state valid once out of local drawing routines.

2002-05-22 08:50 +0000 [r701]  robert:

	* Updates for Doxygen and osgGA headers from Neil.

2002-05-21 19:34 +0000 [r700]  robert:

	* Typo and grammer fixes to introduction.html from Neil Salter.

2002-05-21 09:16 +0000 [r699]  robert:

	  getLastAppliedMode/Attribute() to make it more consistent with
	  the internal workings of osg::State.

2002-05-21 08:59 +0000 [r698]  robert:

	* Added osg::State::getCurrentMode and
	  osg::State::getCurrentAttribute(). Aded osg::clampAbove(..) and
	  osg::clampBelow() template functions to include/osg/Math.

2002-05-21 00:58 +0000 [r697]  don:

	* Modified instrules so that the functionality of instlinks is that
	  system links are not made to point to links, rather the real
	  files. So links installed on a system are pointing to platform
	  specific files rather than links that may be pointing to files of
	  the wrong platform type.

2002-05-18 08:39 +0000 [r694-696]  robert:

	* Various API updates to suppor light points developments better,
	  but should also benifit other extensions to rendering.

	* Made trilinear filtering the default mode for osg::Texture's.

	* Modified the setting of min and mag texture filter modes to
	  produce higher quality mip maps.

2002-05-15 19:58 +0000 [r693]  robert:

	* Fixed problem with orhographic projections due to a bug in
	  CullVisitor where it automatically resets the near and far to the
	  values calculated during cull traversal. The maths for converting
	  the computed far and near into clip coordinates was wrong, fixed
	  this and the problem goes away.

2002-05-15 11:27 +0000 [r692]  robert:

	* Exposed the CullVisitor::setComputeNearFarMode

2002-05-14 10:20 +0000 [r691]  robert:

	* Fix compile problems with osgGA under Windows.

2002-05-09 18:59 +0000 [r683]  robert:

	* Added pixelSize method to CullVisitor, and converted small
	  feature culling to use the pixelSize method instead of a ratio of
	  radius to distance from eye point.
	  setSmallFeatureCullingPixelSize() method has also been added to
	  provide the user with finer control of small featyre culling.

2002-05-09 10:31 +0000 [r682]  robert:

	* Added new osgGA - GUI Adapter library submitted by Neil Salter.
	  This will replace the current GUI adapter code inside osgUtil.

2002-05-08 07:32 +0000 [r681]  robert:

	* Addded missing ClipNode references to osg.dsp.

2002-05-07 11:44 +0000 [r680]  robert:

	  EYE_TO_MODEL transform correctly. Fixed warning in ClipNode.cpp.

2002-05-07 11:12 +0000 [r679]  robert:

	* Support added for OpenFlight switch nodes, submission from Brede
	  Johansen.

	  node, and made it an osg::Group so that it can be used a
	  decorator above a scene. Added osgclip demo to the test suite.

2002-05-02 22:02 +0000 [r674]  robert:

	* Made osg::Viewport::getViewport(..) const.

2002-05-02 00:14 +0000 [r673]  robert:

	* dded osg::ClipNode class for managing OpenGL clipping planes, and
	  osgclip demo.

	* Added Bob to the AUTHORS list for his efforts on MacOSX.

2002-04-25 10:46 +0000 [r654]  robert:

	* A more verbose version of the test script, using each and more
	  memleaks.log to print out progress and report any memory leaks
	  which have been logged. The later will only occur with a debug
	  build. The use of echo and more makes this version osgtest.bat
	  not portable to windows unfortuntately.

2002-04-25 10:14 +0000 [r653]  robert:

	* Added another bullet point to the plan.

	* Added back in as binary file.

	* Temporily removing to change it to a binary file.

2002-04-24 20:57 +0000 [r644]  robert:

	* Merged Bob's changes for MacOSX build. This change is simply the
	  addition of GLUT_LIB to the link line. This change should be
	  removed once we fixed the OSG_LIBS so that it doens't include
	  osgGLUT, however, I'll leave this for another day...

2002-04-24 20:36 +0000 [r643]  robert:

	* Fix for MacOSX build, making sure that the compresed tex image is
	  defined on all builds by removing the #ifdef's but then changing
	  the name used in the typedef so it doesn't collide with local
	  implementations.

	* Changes for Mac OSX build, sent in by Bob Kuehne

2002-04-24 14:52 +0000 [r638]  robert:

	* Removed the use of __FUNCTION__ from MemoryManager to remove
	  problems with VisualStudio .NET compile. Added support for
	  OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL and OSG_FILE_PATH into the relevant getenv
	  routines. This compliments the exisiting OSGNOTIFYLEVEL &
	  OSGFILEPATH which are deprecated but still supported. The OSG_
	  version are more consistent with the rest of the env variables
	  used in the OSG.

2002-04-24 14:14 +0000 [r637]  robert:

2002-04-23 13:59 +0000 [r629]  robert:

	* Seperated out the platform specific implementions of the file
	  search/access routines - we now have FileUtils_Windows.cpp,
	  FileUtils_Mac.cpp and FileUtils_Unix.cpp. The FileUtils_Mac.cpp
	  is based on code submitted by Josh Portway and add uses the
	  carbon API for searching for files.

	  couldn't fix in any easy way.

2002-04-23 10:55 +0000 [r625]  robert:

	* Added an imageList.clear() to osgbillboard so that its memory
	  would be cleared before entering the viewer main loop, this
	  removes memorymanager a reported memory leak due to the viewer
	  using exit() which bypasses the clean up on main itself. Added an
	  osgNew to the ReaderWriterRGB.cpp to aid detected of tracking of
	  memory leaks.

2002-04-23 10:34 +0000 [r624]  robert:

	* Fixed compile problems under VisualStudio w.r.t the new additions
	  for precompiled mipmaps. Changed std::size_t to unsigned int.

2002-04-23 09:06 +0000 [r623]  robert:

	* Replaced texture compression extension define so that its #ifndef
	  guard used GL_ARB_texture_compression as natured intended.

2002-04-23 08:40 +0000 [r622]  robert:

	* Updated ChangeLog in preperation for the 0.8.45 release.

2002-04-23 08:29 +0000 [r620]  robert:

	* Fixed warning in swapBytes, simple addded unsigned to the int
	  loop count, since sizeof() is always an unsigned int.

2002-04-22 23:54 +0000 [r619]  don:

	* Impleneted byte swap for use between machines with different
	  endians.

2002-04-22 21:45 +0000 [r618]  don:

	* Fixed couple of small errors caught by Solaris compiler

	  osg::Plane sent in by Mike Connell.

2002-04-22 21:13 +0000 [r616]  robert:

	* Integrated submission from Boris Bralo: Supported added for
	  precompiled mip maps stored in osg::Image, and read by
	  osg::Texture. Updates to TerraPage loader for support of
	  compressed texture images and precompiled mip maps.

2002-04-22 19:41 +0000 [r615]  robert:

	* Added code in hangglide to move the earth sky around with the eye
	  point, use osg::Transform::ComputeTransformCallback.

2002-04-22 14:54 +0000 [r614]  robert:

	* Added support for compute the near and far planes and then
	  applying to the current projection matrix into CullVisitor

2002-04-22 09:55 +0000 [r613]  robert:

	* Slight changes to FAQ to make a little more relevant, it really
	  needs a total re-write though.

2002-04-22 09:50 +0000 [r612]  robert:

	* Added test script which runs all the demos in the OSG to make
	  sure they run ok. User has to verify they are correct visually.

2002-04-22 09:37 +0000 [r611]  robert:

	* Cleaned up the handling of the Viewport with
	  osg::SceneView/RenderStage and CullVisitor so that the Viewport
	  is now managed as part as the global stateset so that it can be
	  pushed and popped like the rest of state without problems. This
	  makes it easier to have multiple viewports within one scene
	  graph.

2002-04-22 09:31 +0000 [r610]  robert:

	* Fixes the .mlt loading from Ben Discoe.

2002-04-21 22:05 +0000 [r609]  robert:

	* Updated TODO list. Converted AnimationPath so it is now
	  subclassed from osg::Transform::ComputeTransfromCallback() so
	  that it can be directly attached to the scene to move objects
	  about. Changed the osg::SateSet::setGlobalDefaults() so that is
	  sets GL_DEPTH_TEST to ON. Added guards and creation of default
	  helper classes in osgGLUT::Viewer and osgUtil::SceneView so that
	  sensible defaults are used when no settings are used of
	  osg::State/StateSet,osgUtil::RenderStage/RenderGraph/CullVisitor.

2002-04-21 21:53 +0000 [r608]  robert:

	  installation istrucions sit in the doc directory as html files.

2002-04-19 19:55 +0000 [r602]  robert:

	* Changed the implementation of
	  osg::Quat::makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) so that it conforms to
	  the OpenFlight convention of euler angles. Added documentation
	  into Matrix and Quat to reflect this. Added so test code to
	  osgcube for stress testing memory allocation and deallocation.
	  Commented out the registering of app and cull callbacks in
	  osghud.

2002-04-17 11:29 +0000 [r584]  robert:

	* Added a gset->computeNumVertices() which was missing, this was
	  causing models to disappear after application of tri stripping.

2002-04-17 09:48 +0000 [r583]  robert:

	* Changed the osg::Billboard comution so that it get passed in the
	  current modelview matrix rathan than an identity matrix, this
	  matrix is then modified locally. Changed the osg::Matrix set
	  methods so they are inline. Added a few useful comments to
	  MemoryManager.cpp to help people understand the assert's better.

	  to edit the DIRS cruft in a single file in the Make directory
	  instead of having to edit multiple files. Also edited Makefiles
	  that needed to include this file. Also cleaned up txp loader to
	  compile with SunOS. This needs to be retested on other platforms.

2002-04-16 14:57 +0000 [r577]  robert:

	* Added osg::Image::setPixelFormat(..) and
	  setInternalTextureFormat(), and renamed
	  osg::Image::pixelFormat(), internalTextureFormat(),dataType() to
	  osg::Image::getPixelFormat() etc. These changes are to bring it
	  more into line with the style of the rest of the OSG. Updated the
	  rest of the distribution to take account for these names changes.

2002-04-16 14:09 +0000 [r576]  robert:

	* Purge on warnings under Linux.

2002-04-16 11:41 +0000 [r575]  robert:

	* Removed the cached matrices from osg::Camera, so that
	  osg::Camrea::getModelViewMatrix() and
	  osg::Camera::getProjectionMatrix() are calculated on the fly.
	  Removed various redudent methods, including the project and
	  unproject methods which are better supported within
	  osgUtil::SceneView. Added a computeWindowMatrix() method to
	  Viewport, to make it easier to construct a MV*P*W matrix for
	  converting local coords into screen coords and visa versa.
	  Converted SceneView and CullVisitor to use this new method.

2002-04-16 11:36 +0000 [r574]  robert:

	  some in appropriate comments from LongIDRecord, since they were
	  obvious and hang over of a copy and paste job on the code.

2002-04-15 08:09 +0000 [r559]  robert:

	* Fixed display problem with the HUD in osgtext which was caused by
	  the new mods to SceneView not honouring the z near/far
	  calculation flag.

2002-04-14 22:21 +0000 [r558]  robert:

	* Added support for specificing the eye mapping and seperation
	  between the horizontal and veritical split stereo modes. Renamed
	  osg::Image::ensureDimensionArePowerOfTwo() to
	  osg::Image::ensureValidSizeForTexturing().

2002-04-14 20:30 +0000 [r557]  robert:

	* Used a faster method for checking for power of 2 on the image
	  dimensions and did a check on forcing 16bits textures in
	  osg::Texture (which speeds things up on the Umea model which is
	  performance bound by texture memory.), the later check is now
	  commented out.

2002-04-14 13:41 +0000 [r556]  robert:

	* Fixes to osg::Image::createImage(..), and addition of code to

	* Clean up for VisualStudio build

2002-04-13 18:53 +0000 [r552]  robert:

	* Added a space into the project name because it was confusing
	  VisualStudio.

2002-04-13 18:45 +0000 [r551]  robert:

	* Further changes to VisualStudio.dsw for dependancies.

2002-04-12 18:06 +0000 [r545]  robert:

	* Further work on cleaning up SceneView and Camera, in particular
	  moving strereo support out of Camera and into SceneView. Also
	  enabled the option to set the projection and modelview matrices
	  directly on SceneView thereby removing the dependance on
	  osg::Camrea to control the view of the scene.

2002-04-12 14:05 +0000 [r544]  robert:

	* Fixes for Win32 build.

2002-04-12 13:06 +0000 [r543]  robert:

	* Futher updates to VisualStudio files, adding osgstereoimage and
	  osgversion in particular.

2002-04-12 12:51 +0000 [r542]  robert:

	* Added "Core " infront of the osg, osgDB, osgUtil, osgText, and
	  osgGLUT libraries in the Visual Studio workspace/project files.

2002-04-12 12:15 +0000 [r541]  robert:

	* Renamed the osgtext demo project to reflect the name.

2002-04-12 11:57 +0000 [r540]  robert:

	* Added "Demo " and "osgPlugin " infront of all demo and plugin
	  project names to help differentiate them within VisualStudio.

2002-04-12 10:24 +0000 [r539]  robert:

	* Attempt to add osgPlugin infront of the 3ds name to force
	  VisualStudio to present it as plugin in the browser.

2002-04-12 10:12 +0000 [r538]  robert:

	* Reorganised the names of libraries and Demos to make it clear
	  what is what.

2002-04-12 09:53 +0000 [r537]  robert:

	* Fixes for Win32 build

2002-04-12 09:25 +0000 [r535-536]  robert:

	* Removed double reference of osgtexture

	* Removed Metroweks files since they wern't being used, and were
	  not up to date. An attempt at using Metrowerks for MacOSX build
	  failed, and we have Cywgin/Mingwin VisualStudio for windows so
	  there is little need for it.

2002-04-12 08:01 +0000 [r534]  robert:

	* Removed dangling references to NewCullVisitor from osgUtil.dsp.

2002-04-12 06:18 +0000 [r533]  don:

	* Solaris PKG distribution now makes a shar (self-extracting shell
	  archived) changed makepgk to do this. Changed another one of
	  those pesky cout = std::cout in CullVisitor.cpp

2002-04-12 05:09 +0000 [r532]  don:

	* added 'make cleandepend' to build system.

2002-04-12 05:06 +0000 [r531]  don:

	* Added the 'make cleandepend' target to the build system.

2002-04-11 23:20 +0000 [r530]  robert:

	* Added DataVariance enum and set/get fields to osg::Object to help
	  identify which objects have values that vary over the lifetime of
	  the object (DYNAMIC) and ones that do not vary (STATIC). Removed
	  the equivalent code in osg::Transform, StateSet and
	  StateAttribute, as these are now encompassed by the new
	  DataVariance field. Removed MatrixMode enum from Matrix, and
	  associated fields/parameters from osg::Transfrom and
	  osg::NodeVisitor, since MatrixMode was not providing any useful
	  functionality, but made the interface more complex (MatrixMode
	  was an experimental API) Added ReferenceFrame field to
	  osg::Transform which allows users to specify transforms that are
	  relative to their parents (the default, and previous behavior) or
	  absolute reference frame, which can be used for HUD's, camera
	  relative light sources etc etc. Note, the view frustum culling
	  for absolute Transform are disabled, and all their parents up to
	  the root are also automatically have view frustum culling
	  disabled. However, once passed an absolute Transform node culling
	  will return to its default state of on, so you can still cull
	  underneath an absolute transform, its only the culling above
	  which is disabled.

2002-04-11 17:15 +0000 [r528-529]  robert:

	* Added several new methods to osg::Image to help keep track of
	  memory and added osg::Image::readPixels to encapsulate
	  glReadPixels. Reordering of includes in include/osg/Fog and
	  include/osg/Light to remove silly warnings under Visual Studio.

	* Patch to ReadWriter3DS from Mike Connel.

2002-04-11 16:05 +0000 [r527]  don:

	* Backed out bad addition of NewCUllVisitor

2002-04-11 15:54 +0000 [r526]  don:

	* Somehow, cvs forgot to check in a modified Makefile with
	  NewCullVisitor added to it... Hm.. anyway this fixes it.

2002-04-11 13:53 +0000 [r525]  robert:

	* Fix for Win32 build.

2002-04-11 09:16 +0000 [r524]  robert:

	* Changed the comments for Clay Fowlwer about the GLU patch for
	  RedHat7.2 to reflect the new position of the tarball and its new
	  name.

2002-04-11 08:24 +0000 [r523]  robert:

	* Fixed refrences to NewCullVisitor which has now been mapped onto
	  CullVisitor.

2002-04-10 22:10 +0000 [r522]  robert:

	* Copied NewCullVisitor over top of CullVisitor and then removed
	  NewCullVisitor. Added some defines to Image in prep for writing
	  code to determine how big a pixel is.

2002-04-10 21:51 +0000 [r521]  robert:

	* Added new osg::DrawPixels class with encapsulates glDrawPixels as
	  and osg::Drawable. Added osg::Image::readPixels to osg::Image.
	  Made osg::LightSource to default to cullActive set to false to
	  that LightSource nodes don't get culled by default.

2002-04-10 14:34 +0000 [r519-520]  don:

	* Added placeholder .README file to the PKG directory to keep CVS
	  from removing the directory on an update.

	* Removed big honkin' SUN PKG files from cvs distribution.

2002-04-10 01:29 +0000 [r518]  don:

	* Added (previously omitted) libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, libgif to
	  makedefs in the Linux section

2002-04-09 22:54 +0000 [r517]  don:

	* Fixed makedepend to do the right thing.

2002-04-09 21:46 +0000 [r516]  robert:

	* Added setProjectionMatrix and setModelViewMatrix() methods to
	  osg::SceneView, and associated member variables. I have not
	  linked them up to the cull traversal yet, but this will be the
	  next task.

2002-04-09 16:09 +0000 [r515]  robert:

	* Further work on removing Camera references from NewCullVisitor
	  and releted classes, this work paves the way for making
	  osg::Camera an optional extra rather than a requirement for
	  rendering.

2002-04-09 15:51 +0000 [r514]  don:

	* Checking in all Makefile.inst in src/Demos/*. These are the
	  Makefiles that get installed rather than the build Makefiles.

2002-04-09 14:55 +0000 [r513]  don:

	* Added pkgadd distribution for Solaris. Added a cleaner way to
	  install demo source so that installed versions use a simplified
	  makedefs/makerules. Small fix to get osgText to compile with
	  Solaris CC. Constructor declared with a non-const argument, but
	  implemented with const argument.

2002-04-08 16:50 +0000 [r512]  don:

	* Added -lstdc++ to begining of LIBS on link line.. ??

2002-04-08 16:25 +0000 [r511]  don:

	* Put quotes around "DBGF" for multi argument

	* Changed a char* into const char* to fix Solaris build.

	* Fix for VisualStudio's lack of auto_ptr::reset.

2002-04-07 17:47 +0000 [r508]  don:

	* Added a stop gap fix for cygwin build. Previous experiements were
	  creating library and plugin files that looked like system library
	  and system files which would have deleted original files on a
	  'make install'. Cygwin is not tested yet, but this needed to get
	  fixed before a cygwin user wiped out his system library files.

2002-04-06 09:24 +0000 [r507]  robert:

	* Updates to Makefile to reflect recent .cpp additions such as
	  TextureCubeMap, MemoryManager etc.

2002-04-05 02:49 +0000 [r506]  don:

	* Fixed a small oversight in the previous bug fix. in
	  GeoSet::computeBound() _numcoords is NOT necesarily
	  _cindex._size.

2002-04-05 01:52 +0000 [r505]  don:

	* Edited INSTALL for new make and installation procedures. Checking
	  in a fix for Norman Vine Added helprules and help.sh for a
	  long-winded help message if you 'make help'.

2002-04-04 18:01 +0000 [r504]  don:

	* Added Norman Vine's changes for CYGWIN builds Added distrules and
	  makerpms for building RPM distributions Removed old RedHatRPM
	  distribution build directory Added new dist/RPM directory and
	  placed temporary .spec files (these are generated by
	  Make/makerpms and are not intended for stand-alone use, but they
	  keep the directory warm and CVS happy)

2002-04-04 00:30 +0000 [r503]  don:

	* Fixed a small bug in compute bound that caused it to come up with
	  the wrong number if the coord array was indexed, and containing
	  bogus (unindexed, yet in-line) numbers.

2002-04-03 17:53 +0000 [r502]  don:

	* Cleaned up in stallation directives

2002-04-03 17:42 +0000 [r501]  don:

	* Reinstated Norman Vine's TARGET_BASENAME variable in the
	  makefiles and added prefixes and suffixes to libs and plugins.
	  ALl this to accomodate cygwin... Also added INST_SYS_PREFIX and
	  INST_SHARE_PREFIX for installation, as well as "standardizing"
	  the install locations for the various platforms.

2002-04-02 06:58 +0000 [r500]  don:

	* Oops forgot to add makedefs and makerules

2002-04-02 06:44 +0000 [r499]  don:

	* The new order for building OSG. All Makefiles are replaced and
	  the Make directory is left with four files only : makedefs
	  makerules makedirrules instrules These work for all platforms
	  supported so far, which include : Linux Irix Solaris MacOSX
	  Cygwin FreeBSD

2002-04-02 06:27 +0000 [r498]  don:

	* Folded in Bob Kuehne's changes for Mac OSX to makedefs and
	  makerules

2002-04-01 15:37 +0000 [r497]  don:

	* Added cleanlite rules to makerules.new

2002-04-01 04:54 +0000 [r496]  don:

	* *** empty log message ***

2002-04-01 03:39 +0000 [r495]  don:

	* Completed and tested instrules.new

2002-03-31 16:43 +0000 [r494]  don:

	* Added more to instrules and makedefs.new Folded in Randall
	  Hopper's changes for FreeBSD

2002-03-31 16:40 +0000 [r493]  robert:

	* Added new osg::Projection node, and osgUtil::NewCullVisitor which
	  are work in progress for the new support for controlling the
	  projection matrix from within the scene graph. Also Added
	  osg::State::getClippingVolume(), getProjectionMatrix() and
	  getModelViewMatrix() with allows drawables to access the current
	  projection, and model view matrices and the view frustum in local
	  coords to the drawable.

2002-03-31 09:54 +0000 [r492]  robert:

	* Removed reference to malloc.h, replacing by stdlib.h instead.

2002-03-30 21:20 +0000 [r491]  robert:

	* Warnings fixes, submitted by Randall Hopper.

2002-03-30 15:13 +0000 [r490]  robert:

	* Fix for Cygwin build.

2002-03-29 17:26 +0000 [r489]  robert:

	* Move the applying of Projection and ModelView matrices into
	  osg::State so that it now maintains references to the last
	  applied matrices, automatically doing lazy state updating. This
	  simplifies the various places in the OSG which were previously
	  doing the applying, add paves the way for managing the projection
	  matrix within the scene graph. Remove MemoryAdapter and mem_ptr
	  as they arn't being used, and can potentially confuse users by
	  their existance.

2002-03-29 12:23 +0000 [r487-488]  robert:

	* Converted from dos file endings to unix.

	* Fixes for dos endings in MemoryManager.cpp, and compile fix for
	  osgText for Cygwin.

2002-03-29 06:54 +0000 [r486]  don:

	* Added new install rules for makefiles and updated makedefs and
	  makerules... more to come

2002-03-28 23:06 +0000 [r485]  robert:

	* Fixes for IRIX build.

2002-03-28 07:29 +0000 [r484]  don:

	* Couple a fixes in makedefs and makerules

2002-03-28 06:35 +0000 [r483]  don:

	* Added Norman Vines fixeds for cygwin

2002-03-27 23:04 +0000 [r482]  robert:

	* A compile fix to the new Texture subload changes.

2002-03-27 22:51 +0000 [r481]  robert:

	* Added support for setting the texture subload width and height
	  within osg::Texture. The values default to 0, and in this state
	  they are sizes of the glTexSubImage2D are taken from the source
	  image size. This allows the previous setup with no settings for
	  subload size to work as before.

2002-03-27 16:31 +0000 [r480]  robert:

	* Futher updates to MemoryManager, fixed memory leak in osgconv.

2002-03-27 14:56 +0000 [r479]  robert:

	* Updates to various files, replacing delete calls with osgDelete
	  so that greater debugging info can be gleaned.

2002-03-27 10:52 +0000 [r478]  robert:

	* Added support for VERTICAL_SPILT and HORIZONTAL_SPLIT stereo
	  modes.

2002-03-27 06:09 +0000 [r477]  don:

	* Update to makeefs/makerules

2002-03-27 00:55 +0000 [r476]  don:

	* update to makedefs.new makerules.new

2002-03-26 23:52 +0000 [r475]  robert:

	* Added support for osg::MemoryManager which is based upon Paul
	  Nettle's memory manager published at flipcode.com. This can be
	  turned on with the OSG_USE_MEMORY_MANGER option which then uses
	  custom global new and delete operators as well as provide osgNew
	  and osgDelete macro's which add ability to log line and file from
	  which calls are made. Updated osg,osgUtil,osgDB,osgText and
	  osgPlugins/osg to use osgNew/osgDelete, and fixed memory leaks
	  highlighted by the new memory manager.

2002-03-26 21:26 +0000 [r473-474]  don:

	* Adding makedirrrules to Make directory

	* Temporarily adding makedefs.new and makerules.new to keep them
	  separate from current makedefs/makerules files. Will eventually
	  remove all makedefs.* and makerules.* and replace only makedefs
	  and makerules with makedefs.new and makedefs.new

2002-03-25 23:18 +0000 [r472]  robert:

	* Added osg::MemoryManger which is currently based on Paul Nettle's
	  memory manager published at flipcode. I havn't adopted Paul's
	  macro's for new/delete etc, but use osg prefixed versions instead
	  to allow greater flexiblity in handling include ordering. Have
	  fixed a couple of new/delete[] problems which existed as a
	  result. To use the MemoryManager to track memory usage simply add
	  -DOSG_USE_MEMEORY_TRACKING to the compile line. Have yet to move
	  the osg from using new to osgNew, will do this next.

2002-03-25 23:13 +0000 [r471]  robert:

	* Added missing osgstereoimage.dsp

2002-03-25 19:04 +0000 [r470]  robert:

	* Fixes for MacOSX build.

2002-03-23 21:30 +0000 [r468-469]  robert:

	* Fixed warning in DisplaySettings.cpp

	* Moved the exit on escape into Window, and added a virtual free
	  method on both Window an Viewer to clean up the windows, this is
	  now called before exit is finally called, ensure that more more
	  memroy is clean up prior to exit.

2002-03-23 10:55 +0000 [r467]  robert:

	* Added GL_TEXTURE_3D definition for those with gl.h headers which
	  don't contain it.

2002-03-21 15:46 +0000 [r466]  robert:

	* Added missing TextureCubeMap.cpp to cvs.

2002-03-21 12:36 +0000 [r465]  robert:

	* Renamed have_applied_mode, have_applied_attribute, apply_mode,
	  apply_attribute to haveAppliedMode, haveAppliedAttribute,
	  applyMode, applyAttribute to make it more consistent with the
	  general OSG name convetion.

2002-03-21 12:00 +0000 [r463-464]  robert:

	* Added osg:State:have_applied_mode(mode) and
	  have_applied_attribute(type) to make it easier to specify which
	  modes and attributes have been modified without the user
	  requiring to know to what value, or to have an equivilant
	  attribute to pass to the have_applied_attribute method. The
	  original have_applied(mode) and have_applied(attribute) methods
	  have been renamed have_applied_mode(), have_applied_attribute()
	  as this was required to prevent the mode and type values
	  colliding during compile (it was causing a compile error when the
	  method names were the same.)

	* _cullMaskRight was not being initialized in the constructor which
	  was resulting in some sporadic problems when running stereo -
	  occoasionally the right eye view wouldn't appear!

2002-03-21 07:50 +0000 [r462]  don:

	* Modified files reflect small changes to work with Sun OS port....
	  Removed redundant README file in osgviews... was a copy of
	  sgv/README.

2002-03-20 22:39 +0000 [r461]  robert:

	* Added osg::TextureCubeMap which encapsulates OpenGL's cube
	  texture mapping.

2002-03-20 14:03 +0000 [r460]  robert:

	* Added a Referenced::unref_nodelete() method which unreferences
	  but does not delete the object even if its count goes to 0 or
	  below. This should only be called in special circumstances, the
	  ReaderWriter::ReadResult being one of them. This new method has
	  allowed the problem of objects being multiple referenced on
	  return from readNodeFile() & readImageFile().

2002-03-20 11:24 +0000 [r458-459]  robert:

	* Updates to Texture and TextureCubeMap to clean up the code so
	  they share much more of the core texture setup code. This largely
	  invloved paramterizing the applyImmediateMode, which has also
	  been rename applyTexImage to reflect its functionality better.

	* Added the fallback of intersecting with the a drawables bounding
	  box, if the drawable isn't a GeoSet and hence supported by the
	  IntersectVisitor's GeoSet primitive intersections code.

2002-03-18 23:10 +0000 [r457]  robert:

	* Added osg::TextureCubeMap. submission from Brede Johansen.

2002-03-18 22:03 +0000 [r456]  robert:

	* Fixed the MS version number check in Optiizer.cpp. Fixes to
	  memory handling in ReaderWriterDW.cpp. Submissions from Geoff
	  Michel.

2002-03-18 21:56 +0000 [r455]  don:

	* Changes required for SUN Solaris port...

2002-03-17 18:44 +0000 [r454]  robert:

	* Added new osgstereoimage demo which loads two stero paired images
	  to create a 3D via of photographed scene.

2002-03-14 23:19 +0000 [r453]  robert:

	* Fix of a delete char array so it used delete [].

2002-03-14 20:29 +0000 [r452]  don:

	* Fixed a problem for finding MIPS 64 bit libraries. Was seaching
	  for LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY64_PATH

2002-03-14 17:34 +0000 [r451]  robert:

	* Integrated various changes worked on at the Glasgow Science
	  Center. Changes include change the CameraManipulators so they
	  work with double for time instead of float. Also added support
	  for DataType to osg::StateAttribute and StateSet so that they can
	  be set to either STATIC or DYNAMIC, this allows the optimizer to
	  know whether that an attribute can be optimized or not.

2002-03-14 16:42 +0000 [r450]  robert:

	* Added a TextureCallback which cycles through various filter
	  modes, used in testing new glTextParamters update functionality.
	  I have commented out the call to attaching of the callback so
	  osgtexture outwardly behaves as before. The code lies dormant
	  just incase we need to use it for testing in the future.

2002-03-14 16:01 +0000 [r449]  robert:

	* Changed Texture so that is use lazy updating on texture paramters
	  (Filter/Wrap) mode by using a _texParamtersDirty flag in
	  combination with an applyTexParamters(State&) method which does
	  the paramters setting in one tidy bundle. This new
	  implementations replaces the CompileFlags submitted yesterday.
	  Simplified NodeCallback by remove osg::NodeCallback::Requirements
	  as they are no longer needed. Fixed comments in Drawable. Put
	  guards around cosf definations so that they are only used under
	  Win32/Mac. Fixed warning in CullVisitor.

2002-03-14 15:26 +0000 [r448]  robert:

	* Fix to handling of big/little endian in trpage_readbuf sent in by
	  Randall Hopper, and a waning fix.

2002-03-14 00:07 +0000 [r447]  don:

	* Fixed compile flags in Texture

2002-03-13 22:44 +0000 [r446]  don:

	* Fixed DrawCallback in Drawable and added CullCallback to Drawable
	  Cull Visitor now checks for a Drawable's CullCallback and calls
	  it if it exists. It then prunes based on the return value (bool)
	  of the cull callback.

2002-03-09 10:54 +0000 [r441-445]  robert:

	* Support added for pivot points, submission from Mike Connel.

	* Fixed setWindowWidth call to account for width and height
	  correctly.

	* TXP plugin updates from Boris Bralo.

	* TXP plugin changes submitted by Boris Bralo.

	* TXP plugin update from Boris Bralo.

2002-03-04 01:37 +0000 [r440]  robert:

	* Added file extension guard to .obj reader plugin.

2002-03-03 22:31 +0000 [r439]  robert:

	* Added support for seperate traversal masks for standard, left and
	  right cull traversals. This allows one to create seperate
	  rendering for left and right eyes when doing stereo.

2002-03-02 09:24 +0000 [r438]  robert:

	* Added a GL vesion number check to LightModel, and small typo fix
	  in Registry.

2002-03-01 09:29 +0000 [r435-437]  robert:

	* Added getInverse implementation to AnimationPath, and added #if
	  guard to Optimizer.cpp to all compilation on state optimizer when
	  using VS7.

	* Fixes to osgText to improve robustness when running multithreaded
	  multipipe apps.

	* Updates to the clamp to border support in osg::Texture.

2002-02-28 00:11 +0000 [r434]  robert:

	* Added support for setting the maximum number of graphics contexts
	  that the OSG has to maintian.

2002-02-27 22:12 +0000 [r433]  robert:

	* Added an using namespace osg to fix a MipsPro7.3 build error.

2002-02-27 22:04 +0000 [r432]  robert:

	* Updated AUTHORS file with Boris' email address.

2002-02-27 22:00 +0000 [r430-431]  robert:

	* Integrated support for GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_ARB extension to
	  osg::Texture, submitted by Sasa Bistrovic.

	* Fixes to DW loader, submitted by Geoff Michel.

2002-02-27 00:58 +0000 [r429]  robert:

	* Added new osg::AnimationPath which is contaner for a set of key
	  frames for defining an animation path. To be used with
	  osg::Transform etc.

2002-02-26 20:01 +0000 [r428]  robert:

	* Added makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) to Quat in prep for new
	  classes for animation paths.

2002-02-25 23:14 +0000 [r427]  robert:

	* Added LightModel.cpp's to Codewarrior files and added
	  definiations for pre gl version 1.2 headers lack of support for
	  color control.

2002-02-25 22:46 +0000 [r426]  robert:

	* Added support for glLightModel functionality via osg::LightModel.

2002-02-24 23:03 +0000 [r424]  robert:

	* Updated docs, ChangLog and NEW for patched version of 0.8.44.

2002-02-24 20:55 +0000 [r422]  robert:

	* Added support for glLineStipple via osg::LineStipple state
	  attribute.

2002-02-24 20:21 +0000 [r421]  robert:

	* Removed Metrowerks.mcp as it has not been kept up to date since
	  October, the new OpenSceneGraph.mcp replaces it.

2002-02-24 16:49 +0000 [r420]  robert:

	* Integrated fixes to the detailed depth calculation in the
	  CullVisitor from Sasa, and fix to the IntersectVisitor's
	  management of path from Sean.

2002-02-23 00:16 +0000 [r419]  robert:

	* Updates to Windows Codwarrior file

2002-02-22 23:40 +0000 [r417-418]  robert:

	* updates for Win32 Codewarrior build

	* Fix for win32 Codewarrior build

2002-02-22 17:12 +0000 [r416]  robert:

	* Add support for Metrowerks Codewarrior build under Windows.

2002-02-19 18:59 +0000 [r414]  robert:

	* fixed txp build name problem - was overwriting .osg plugin.

2002-02-18 23:01 +0000 [r413]  robert:

	* Fixed stereo implementation.

2002-02-18 21:52 +0000 [r412]  robert:

	* Fixes to Win32 build of new DX writer plugin.

2002-02-18 20:48 +0000 [r410-411]  robert:

	* Comment w.r.t OpenDX plugin updated.

	* Added OpenDX writer from Randall Hopper.

2002-02-14 13:26 +0000 [r409]  robert:

	* Beginings of reimplementation of stereo support in scene view.
	  Work not complete yet.

2002-02-14 12:55 +0000 [r408]  robert:

	* updated the options for the txp plugin.

2002-02-14 12:51 +0000 [r407]  robert:

	* Removed osgWX workspace files.

2002-02-14 11:06 +0000 [r406]  robert:

	* Fixed impostor bug introduced when new modelview matrix was moved
	  entirely within the cull traversal/draw traversal. The impostor
	  code has been adapted to the new convention.

2002-02-13 22:56 +0000 [r403-405]  robert:

	* Updated the makefiles to all have the #!gmake reference to force
	  IRIX compilation using gmake rather than pmake or smake. This
	  gets round issues with exporting OSGHOME.

	* Updated the osgconv support for orientation conversion so that it
	  used inserted a static transform to do the work of rotating the
	  scene, then applied a standard
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlattenStaticTransformsVisitor traversal to
	  flatten the transfrom down on to the geometry nodes.

	* Fixed the fabsf define which was eroneous mapped to sqrtf, due to
	  the copy and paste antipattern no doubt.

2002-02-13 00:13 +0000 [r402]  robert:

	* Fixed problems with intersection visitor coupled with the viewer.

2002-02-13 00:00 +0000 [r401]  robert:

	* Added sgv -stereo cessna.osg to make test list.

2002-02-12 23:49 +0000 [r400]  robert:

	* Added a set of test runs to the makefiles and demos. The demos
	  now have titles relevenat to their function.

2002-02-12 22:51 +0000 [r399]  robert:

	* Updates for IRIX build, and docs updates.

2002-02-12 22:35 +0000 [r398]  robert:

	* Removed references to osgWX from the doc++ directory.

2002-02-12 08:23 +0000 [r397]  robert:

	* Updates to Transform and CullVistor to support new
	  getLocalToWorldMatrix methods.

2002-02-11 23:24 +0000 [r396]  robert:

	* Updates to Transform handling in CullVisitor, in prep for moving
	  camera modelview and projection into Transform nodes.

2002-02-11 22:53 +0000 [r395]  robert:

	* Clean up of TXP plugin for IRIX build.

2002-02-11 19:51 +0000 [r394]  robert:

	* Cleand up the root Makefile. Moved
	  CullVisitor/RenderStage/RenderStageLighting across to managing
	  lights entirely within RenderStageLighting, and changed the
	  management of modelview matrices so that RenderLeaf now stores
	  the absolute modelview matrix, rather than a model matrix as done
	  previously. The later allows RenderLeaf's to do a glLoadMatrix
	  rather than a glPushMatrix/glMultMatrix/glPopMatrix.

2002-02-11 15:09 +0000 [r393]  robert:

	* Fixed Linux hang of the TXP loader by overriding the default -O2
	  optimization level which appears to cause the code to hang, -O
	  works fine for some strange reason, I havn't found any direct
	  problems in the code. This may be compiler bug or a code bug, the
	  bug may go away in later versions of GNUC++, the problem
	  currently occurs under GCC2.96.

2002-02-11 12:51 +0000 [r392]  robert:

	* Applied fix to transparancy in flt loader.

2002-02-11 03:26 +0000 [r391]  robert:

	* Fixed the date on the release.

2002-02-11 02:38 +0000 [r389]  robert:

	* Updated changelog for release.

2002-02-11 02:34 +0000 [r388]  robert:

	* Fixed a make install error on the plugins related to the old
	  definitions for plugin names hanging around despite being
	  deprecated. These definiations confused the make install/make
	  instclean so it tried to link a non existant library. Have
	  removed old definitions and everything intalls properly once
	  more:-)

2002-02-11 01:02 +0000 [r386]  robert:

	* Updated changelog.

2002-02-11 00:51 +0000 [r384]  robert:

	* Did a make docs, in prep for the 0.8.44 release.

2002-02-11 00:42 +0000 [r382-383]  robert:

	* Added missing doc++ generated .html files.

	* Updated Stats code, sent in by Geof Michel.

2002-02-11 00:23 +0000 [r381]  robert:

	* Clean up INSTALL notes.

2002-02-10 23:19 +0000 [r380]  robert:

	* Updateds NEWS for the 0.8.44 release. Change the
	  osg::NodeVisitor::getLocalToWorldMatrix() /
	  getWorldToLocalMatrix() methods so it do not initilize the matrix
	  being passed to them, and assume the the users has already
	  initiliazed them appropriately, such as to take account of camera
	  positions.

2002-02-10 22:35 +0000 [r379]  robert:

	* Implemented NodeVisitor's getLocalToWorldMatrix and
	  getWorldToLocalMatrix to allow users to querry the current
	  accumulated matrix state within the scene graph.

2002-02-10 20:05 +0000 [r378]  robert:

	* Disbalbed a dumb warning in Windows build via a #pragma.

2002-02-10 17:16 +0000 [r377]  robert:

	* Fixed a bug in the drive manipulator which was due to it using
	  the local coords of the intersection point with the scene rather
	  than the world coord value for that point. The code now uses
	  osgUtil::Hit::getWorldIntersectionPoint() method for getting the
	  world coords. Added support for getWorldIntersectionPoint to
	  Viewer.cpp. Put and #ifdef around the setting of the default
	  display list visitor so it nolonger sets in under IRIX. This is a
	  world around to the IR graphics imbending lighting info into
	  display lists, if the display lists are created before state is
	  set up it produces lighting artifacts such as flickering. Remove
	  the the default display list init visitor removes these problems,
	  display lists are then built on the fly and drawables a drawn for
	  the first time.

2002-02-10 11:17 +0000 [r376]  robert:

	* Fixes for MacOSX build.

2002-02-10 10:42 +0000 [r375]  robert:

	* Fixes to TXP loader for Cygwin and Ming builds.

2002-02-09 22:29 +0000 [r374]  robert:

	* Fixed the osgUtil::Optimizer::FlattenStaticTransformVisitor so
	  that it does not flatten drawables which have double references
	  to them, but only one reference with a static transform on it.
	  This case can't be flattened but this wasn't picked up. The code
	  now detects the case correctly.

2002-02-09 21:29 +0000 [r373]  robert:

	* Updates to BMP loader from Geoff Michel.

2002-02-09 19:46 +0000 [r372]  robert:

	* Added std:: infront of string refrences to solve compile problems
	  under gcc 3.0.3. Also converted to unix file endings so other the
	  windows style files.

2002-02-09 14:29 +0000 [r371]  robert:

	* Updates to docs and fixes to a few warnings.

2002-02-09 10:54 +0000 [r370]  robert:

	* Updated docs.

2002-02-09 10:50 +0000 [r369]  robert:

	* Fix to BMP loader.

2002-02-09 10:24 +0000 [r368]  robert:

	* Fixes for cygwin and mingw builds.

2002-02-08 23:07 +0000 [r366-367]  robert:

	* Removed further wxsgv files.

	* Removed osgWX and wxsgv from the repositry as it is intend to
	  keep the core distribution clean from GUI examples, these instead
	  should live in the bazaar. This can better accomodate the many
	  different types of viewer that users are developming.

2002-02-08 22:55 +0000 [r365]  robert:

	* Added support for parents to Drawables. Bumped up version numbers
	  in prep for 0.8.44.

2002-02-08 09:30 +0000 [r364]  robert:

	* Fixes for IRIX and Boris Bralo's TerraPage loader.

2002-02-07 08:07 +0000 [r363]  robert:

	* Fixed teh setDrawCallback so that it now calls dirtyDisplayList()
	  instead of dirtyBound.

2002-02-07 01:17 +0000 [r361-362]  robert:

	* Fix for Win32 build.

	* Various investigations into culling errors w.r.t matrix inversion
	  resulted in the conclusion that the osg::Matrix::inverse was
	  broken, have lifted a new implementation from sgl and it seems to
	  work fine. Will need further testing but looks good.

2002-02-07 01:12 +0000 [r359-360]  robert:

	* Fix for the handling of lighting in the DW loader.

	* Added a check to the destructor of Referenced so that it detects
	  referenced objects that are deleted whilest still having a
	  positive _refCount, such as when a object has been deleted on the
	  stack, yet other references still exist for it. Have put the
	  desctructor implementation in Object.cpp to avoid adding yet
	  another file with only a couple of lines of code in.

2002-02-07 01:07 +0000 [r357-358]  robert:

	* Added callbacks to allow users to modify the underlying
	  functionality of LOD, Billboard and Drawabel objects.

	* Added extensions code submitted by Yefrei.

2002-02-06 08:57 +0000 [r356]  robert:

	* Compile fixes.

2002-02-05 21:54 +0000 [r355]  robert:

	* Have taken a few more steps towards support for view dependant
	  transformations by adding a ComputeTransformCallback to
	  osg::Transform, and have now removed the recently added
	  AutoTransform since it is nolonger required. Have also updated
	  CullVisitor to account for the new ways for tracking
	  transformation matrices in the scene.

2002-02-05 21:51 +0000 [r354]  robert:

	* Have removed the old lazy initialization of Matrix since it was
	  causing bugs and adding checks to many mothods which in the end
	  slow it down more than not intilizing the code! The code is now
	  simpler, more robust and faster:-)

2002-02-05 10:49 +0000 [r353]  robert:

	* Added comment to flt2osg's handling of osg::Material setup w.r.t
	  osg::Material::_colorMode.

2002-02-03 22:32 +0000 [r352]  don:

	* added shademodel to TARGET_INCLUDE_FILES

2002-02-03 20:57 +0000 [r351]  robert:

	* Added beginings of new AutoTransform class.

2002-02-03 19:18 +0000 [r350]  robert:

	* Fixes for GCC 3.0.3 build.

2002-02-03 12:33 +0000 [r349]  robert:

	* Removed the trailing ; after namespace {...} declariations in
	  headers which was being picked as a warning under Codewarrior.

2002-02-03 11:38 +0000 [r347-348]  robert:

	* Added first cut at new AutoTransform node which will be used for
	  generating Transform's during the cull traversal such as for
	  earth/sky etc.

	* Updates for Borland compilation.

2002-02-02 20:07 +0000 [r346]  robert:

	* Added defined( __BCPLUSPLUS__) to windows export code segments.

2002-02-02 19:49 +0000 [r345]  robert:

	* Fixed a copy and paste error which was causing compile problems
	  under Windows, due to a incorrect comparison of objects of
	  different types.

2002-02-02 10:52 +0000 [r344]  robert:

	* Typo fixed in the header guard.

2002-01-30 19:59 +0000 [r343]  robert:

	* Fixed clone(CopyOp&) and cloneType() methods which were out of
	  sync with the new style clone operations.

2002-01-30 18:59 +0000 [r342]  robert:

	* Fixes for Windows build

2002-01-30 16:24 +0000 [r341]  robert:

	* Fixes for Windows build.

2002-01-30 15:27 +0000 [r340]  robert:

	* Removed the M_PI defines from include/osg/Math and have use a
	  const double osg::PI etc in its place.

2002-01-30 15:02 +0000 [r337-339]  robert:

	* Changes for Borland C++ compiler changes.

	* Added osgbillboard project files to the VisualStudio workspace.

	* Added osgbillboard demo. The code is main a copy of osgtexture
	  right now, my plan to do change it to make it a better demo of
	  the different types of billboard that one can do.

2002-01-30 14:37 +0000 [r336]  robert:

	* Removed a Makedepend that didn't belong!

2002-01-30 13:15 +0000 [r335]  robert:

	* Fixed the rotation direction of the POINT_ROT_* modes, this was
	  broken by earlier fixes to the osg::Matrix.

2002-01-30 12:09 +0000 [r334]  robert:

	* Made the LineSegment destructor protected to force users to
	  create segments on the stack thus ensure that they arn't created
	  locally and have their memory deleted incorrectly. Also updated
	  the IntersectVisitor so that it no used osg::ref_ptr<> internally
	  for storing all data. Have also move the IntersectState helper
	  class to inside the IntersectVisitor which simplifies the
	  external interface to the class.

2002-01-29 20:25 +0000 [r333]  robert:

	* Fixes for windows build.

2002-01-29 14:20 +0000 [r332]  robert:

	* Removed the now rendundent DeepCopy and ShallowCopy files.

2002-01-29 14:04 +0000 [r331]  robert:

	* Moved all references to osg::Cloner to osg::CopyOp.

2002-01-29 12:55 +0000 [r330]  robert:

	* Fixed the header guard, which was using the name define as
	  FileUtils. Problem spotted by Terry Welsh.

2002-01-29 12:52 +0000 [r329]  robert:

	* Have add new osg::CopyOp which replaces last nights osg::Cloner,
	  the new class now combines Cloner and DeepCopy into one class.
	  Cloner and DeepCopy will be removed in next commit. Also have
	  added osgcopy app to Demos which shows how the CopyOp have be
	  subclassed to create users own specific handling of copying. Have
	  fixed copy constructor problems in GeoSet which fix the deep copy
	  problem experienced yesterday.

2002-01-28 21:49 +0000 [r328]  robert:

	* A couple of fixes to DeepCopy Cloner.

2002-01-28 21:17 +0000 [r327]  robert:

	* Added support for shallow and deep copy of nodes, drawables and
	  state, via a copy constructor which takes an optional Cloner
	  object, and the old osg::Object::clone() has changed so that it
	  now requires a Cloner as paramter. This is passed on to the copy
	  constructor to help control the shallow vs deep copying. The old
	  functionality of clone() which was clone of type has been renamed
	  to cloneType(). Updated all of the OSG to work with these new
	  conventions, implemention all the required copy constructors etc.
	  A couple of areas will do shallow copies by design, a couple of
	  other still need to be updated to do either shallow or deep.
	  Neither of the shallow or deep copy operations have been tested
	  yet, only the old functionality of the OSG has been checked so
	  far, such running the viewer on various demo datasets. Also fixed
	  a problem in osg::Optimize::RemoveRendundentNodesVisitor which
	  was not checking that Group didn't have have any attached
	  StateSet's, Callbacks or UserData. These checks have now been
	  added, which fixes a bug which was revealled by the new osgscribe
	  demo, this related to removal of group acting as state decorator.
	  method

2002-01-27 20:28 +0000 [r326]  robert:

	* Added
	  stateset->setMode(GL_LIGHTING,osg::StateAttribute::OVERRIDE_ON);
	  to scribbed subgraph so that lighting is always on, this is
	  needed since glMaterial is only active when lighting is enabled.

2002-01-26 20:03 +0000 [r325]  robert:

	* Added VisualStudio workspace files for new osgscribe demo.

2002-01-26 19:48 +0000 [r324]  robert:

	* Added new osgscribe demo which demostrates how to create a
	  wireframe overlay of a model.

2002-01-26 14:13 +0000 [r323]  robert:

	* Fixed the LOD center and range code that so that the values are
	  now multiple by the _unitScale to compenstate for different
	  scales in the flt model. This _unitScale had already been applied
	  to the geometry data. Integrated new defaults for the texturing
	  wrap mode, for when now .attr file is supplied with a flt file.

2002-01-23 22:15 +0000 [r322]  robert:

	* Have made osg::Transform more extensible via additions of new
	  getLocalToWorldMatrix() and getWorldToLocalMatrix(),
	  computeLocalToWorld() and computeWorldToLocal() methods. Have
	  updated the CullVisitor, IntersectVisitor and Optimizer to use
	  the new osg::Transform::getLocalToWorldMatrix() which has the
	  same functionality as the old getMatrix() but is now supports
	  subclasses of osg::Transform transparently. Have added
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform as subclass of osg::Transform
	  which manages the transform as position and attitude via a Vec3
	  and Quat respectively.

2002-01-23 15:42 +0000 [r321]  robert:

	* Updates to osg::Transform to allow it subclassed more easily.

2002-01-23 15:28 +0000 [r320]  robert:

	* Fixed problem with Optimzer::removeRedundentNodesVisitor which
	  was removing the correct redundent groups but for groups which
	  had a single child it was was not using replaceChild to rettach
	  the child to its parents. It was using
	  parent->removeChild(group)...parent->addChild(child); which was
	  allow the child to be attached in a different place than the
	  original group, this broke LOD code. Have used removeChild
	  instead which solves the LOD problem.

2002-01-23 12:04 +0000 [r319]  robert:

	* Changed the ordering of applying OpenGL modes and attributes back
	  to the original modes first then attributes since the it was
	  cause a display bug on some datesets. It seems that the modes
	  needs enabling before glMaterial's take affect, at least on the
	  NVidia drivers under Windows and Linux. The OpenGL reference
	  guide doesn't mention any dependancy so I'm not sure what the
	  official line is. Some other OpenGl attribute and modes need to
	  be applied in that order according to the blue book, however,
	  drivers, at least the NVidia drivers seem require the opposite.
	  This may raise the spectra of before and after mode applies, but
	  this will require extra support in osg::State and
	  osg::StateAttribute, and would have to be handled on a per
	  attribute basis, and possibly different of each platform. Yuck.

2002-01-22 19:30 +0000 [r318]  robert:

	* Fixed FlattenStaticTransformVisitor bug which related to
	  incorrect handling of objects which were transformed by multiple
	  matrices at one time - this cannot be handled in the flattening
	  process (since we only have one piece of geometry to transform).
	  This visitor now handles this case by disabling flattening of any
	  objects and transforms associated in this way.

2002-01-22 12:03 +0000 [r317]  robert:

	* Temporily commented out the call to the
	  FlatternStaticTransformVisitor to prevent a bug in handling
	  instance nodes. Will be commented back in once the bug has been
	  solved.

2002-01-22 11:03 +0000 [r315-316]  robert:

	* Updated AUTHORS file to reflect recent submission.

	* Added support for node instances to Open Flight loader. Submitted
	  by Yefei He.

2002-01-20 19:30 +0000 [r314]  robert:

	* Fixes to Windows compile.

2002-01-20 16:24 +0000 [r313]  robert:

	* Updates to help compilation under gcc 3.03.

2002-01-19 22:11 +0000 [r312]  robert:

	* Converted osgUtil::GUIEventAdapter::MouseButtonMask from
	  LEFT_BUTTON etc to LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON etc, to prevent classes with
	  #define of LEFT_BUTTON.. when including certain MS Windows
	  headers. Arhsh Snarfff..

2002-01-19 20:34 +0000 [r311]  robert:

	* Fixed the handling of non transparent billboards, since it was
	  not taking into account any accumulated transforms inherited from
	  above.

2002-01-18 22:36 +0000 [r309-310]  robert:

	* UPdates to CullVisitor so that it keeps in sync with the new
	  method paramter change in osg::Billboard. Removed in instance of
	  an object being passed () brackets, have removed the brackets to
	  avoid an amiguity with the compiler intepreting it as a function.

	* Changes to fix compilation problems on the Sparc. GeoSet.cpp
	  simply remove rendundent code that had already been commented
	  out.

2002-01-18 22:25 +0000 [r308]  robert:

	* Added support for multiple graphics contexts, submission from Max
	  Rhiener. Alas changed the indenting to use 4 spaces instead of
	  tabs, this irons out differences when working under Windows and
	  Unix, keeping the identing consistent.

2002-01-18 22:15 +0000 [r307]  robert:

	* First steps to updating the calcTransform function in Billboard
	  to fix z axis contraint on rotation axis.

2002-01-18 19:00 +0000 [r306]  robert:

	* Fixed copy constructor which was copying a matrix to unitialized
	  memory.

2002-01-18 14:12 +0000 [r304-305]  robert:

	* Removed the global scope operators for the isnan(..) etc calls to
	  fix compilation under some compiler combinations.

	* Made the osg::Timer::tick() method a const method.

2002-01-18 10:26 +0000 [r303]  robert:

	* Fixed typo in comment, reference to BoundingSphere has been
	  changed to BoundingBox. Typo spotted by Gial Paolo Lorenzetto.

2002-01-17 22:41 +0000 [r301-302]  robert:

	* Fixed ENALBE_ALL_CULLING spelling mistake, have changed it to
	  ENABLE_ALL_CULLING.

	* Added support for glutSpecialFunc, glutSpaceballMotion,
	  glutSpaceballRotate and glutSpaceballRotate into osgGLUT::Window
	  base class.

2002-01-16 21:23 +0000 [r298-300]  robert:

	* Reversed the ordering of setting of OpenGL modes and attributes,
	  so that attributes are now set first, then modes. This is keep
	  consistent with the setting of glColorMaterial and
	  glEnable(GL_COLOR_MATERIAL) as specfied in OpenGL documentation.

	* Changed the enum Types { ... } so that in no longer explicitly
	  sets the values, leaving C++ to ensire that values are unque and
	  insequence.

	* Fixes to makefiles which have become a bit unhinged after MacOS X
	  integration.

2002-01-16 21:12 +0000 [r297]  robert:

	* Added support for billboard in OpenFlight loader. Submission from
	  Nikolaus Hanekamp.

2002-01-16 12:29 +0000 [r296]  robert:

	* Submission from Sean Spicer which adds Make/makedefs.irix.std.64
	  which compiles the OSG as 64bit. Small changes by Robert to
	  accomodate recent MacOSX makefile changes.

2002-01-16 12:08 +0000 [r295]  robert:

	* Changes to Make/makerules.* and Make/makedefs.* to accomodate
	  MacOSX's need to treat plugins and shared libraries seperately.

2002-01-16 12:05 +0000 [r293-294]  robert:

	* Integrated the changes to osgPlugin/Makefile's for MacOSX port.

	* Changed hardwired char[1024] arrays to
	  char[FILEUTILS_MAX_PATH_LENGTH] and defined the value to be 2048,
	  this should avoid problems with path lengths which have been
	  overflowing the 1024 limit (Sasa report this bug). The real
	  solution is to use std::string throught FileUtils, but this will
	  have to wait for another day.

2002-01-16 10:41 +0000 [r292]  robert:

	* Added quicktime plugin (for Mac's only), submitted by Phil Atkin.

2002-01-16 10:36 +0000 [r291]  robert:

	* First batch of changes required for MacOS X build. Orignal
	  submission from Phil Atkin, merged by Robert Osfield.

2002-01-15 23:21 +0000 [r290]  robert:

	* Changed the use of std::vector<..>.begin() to &vector<..>.front()
	  in code from passing the vector contents to the
	  GeoSet::setPrimLengths(..) etc. methods. This has been done to
	  fix the compile under the MS .NET compiler which has changed the
	  definiation of the std::vector<..>::iterator to a class rather
	  than a pointer.

2002-01-15 19:54 +0000 [r289]  robert:

	* Fix to osgDB::getStrippedName(..) so that handles the case of
	  file without an extension.

2002-01-15 15:49 +0000 [r288]  robert:

	* Added '# LIBS += -limage' and explanation in comments to pfb
	  Makefile, submitted by Randall Hooper.

2002-01-15 12:13 +0000 [r287]  robert:

	* Added the set of GL_TEXTURE_GEN_S and _T to code converting
	  pfTexGen to osg::TexGen. This is try and fix a bug in handling
	  tex gen datasets such as sj_texgen.pfb.

2002-01-15 11:05 +0000 [r286]  robert:

	* New ajustAspectRatio (ADJUST_NODE) mode added to osg::Camera to
	  fix issue with integration with vrjuggler, submitted by Allen
	  Bierbaum.

2002-01-12 21:49 +0000 [r285]  robert:

	* Missing _attachedTransformMode in osg::Camera constructor, fix
	  submitted by Ben Discoe.

2002-01-05 16:19 +0000 [r283-284]  robert:

	* Change TOP to OSGHOME in makefiles.

	* Moved the setting of camera fusion distance mode into the handle
	  method so that it is updated on everyframe to ensure that
	  switching between Drive/Flight and Trackball happens seemlessly.

2002-01-04 20:44 +0000 [r281-282]  robert:

	* Renamed the TOP variable in the Makefiles to OSGHOME.

	* Added a guard to osg::LOD::evaluate so that it returns -1 if the
	  range matched does not have a corresponding child to relate to.
	  This can happen if a user creates more than n+1 ranges, where n
	  is the number of LOD children.

2002-01-04 17:35 +0000 [r279-280]  robert:

	* Added osg::ShadeModel state attribute which encapsulates
	  glShadeModel.

	* Fixed a bug in writing of line strips and line loops to the .osg
	  file.

2002-01-04 13:14 +0000 [r278]  robert:

	* Fixed multiple deletion of shared indecies in GeoSet destructor.

2002-01-03 23:28 +0000 [r277]  robert:

	* Futher Makefile updates for Cygwin support - from Norman Vine.

2002-01-03 23:19 +0000 [r276]  robert:

	* Makefile changes to support Cywin port - submission from Norman
	  Vine, updates to fix case problems under unix by Robert.

2002-01-03 21:34 +0000 [r275]  robert:

	* Updates for Cygwin port, from Norman Vine.

2002-01-03 19:28 +0000 [r274]  robert:

	* Small source code changes for Cygwin port of OSG.

2002-01-02 17:01 +0000 [r272]  robert:

	* Updates in preperation for the third attempt at the 0.8.43
	  release.

2002-01-02 15:42 +0000 [r271]  robert:

	* Updates from Randall Hopper to fix build under IRIX.

2002-01-02 11:03 +0000 [r270]  robert:

	* A small bug fix to the matrix dump function (it was primtiing out
	  5 columns instead of four). Added support for multiplying mesh
	  geometry by the matrix attached to the Lib3dsMesh structure,
	  however this produces disjointed models so have to the default
	  mode to bypass this multiplication code. Will need to revisit
	  this in the future.

2002-01-02 10:59 +0000 [r269]  robert:

	* Commented out the smoothing of FLAT_TRIANGLE_STRIP and
	  FLAT_TRIANGLE_FAN since it was causes problems with any color
	  list which were attached.

2002-01-02 10:53 +0000 [r268]  robert:

	* Moved the glShadeModel(FLAT/SMOOTH) outside of the primtitive
	  inner loop to reduce the amount state changes incurred when using
	  FLAT_ primtives.

2002-01-02 10:49 +0000 [r267]  robert:

	* Fixed the orientation of for_each_triangle cases for QUAD and
	  QUAD_STRIP.

2001-12-31 23:21 +0000 [r266]  robert:

	* Removed the variables which were duplicated in osgGLUT::Viewer
	  and osgGLUT::Window, standardising on the Window ones, and
	  therefore removing an unitialized variable that had been
	  introduced. This caused a crash under WindowsXP due to send
	  invalid values to glutReshapeWindow.

2001-12-31 23:16 +0000 [r265]  robert:

	* Added a more detailed explanation of how LOD's work.

2001-12-31 00:04 +0000 [r263]  robert:

	* Updates to NEWS for date of release, and added
	  include/osg/DisplaySettings and include/osg/LineWidth to the
	  src/osg/Makefile.

	  handled by the for_each_triangle template function.

2001-12-30 19:04 +0000 [r259]  robert:

	* Added /usr/local/lib to the s_default_dso_path search path for
	  plugins.

2001-12-30 17:13 +0000 [r258]  robert:

	* Made the output message related to not registering a camera
	  manipulator with the GLUT Viewer output as INFO rather than as a
	  NOTICE. This suppress this message which was appearing on some of
	  the demos all the time, even though are quite reasonable default
	  behaviour is used.

2001-12-30 16:59 +0000 [r256-257]  robert:

	* Added references to sgv -stereo and sgv -stencil to the notes of
	  running the demos.

	* Updated the default home position of so that a better view of the
	  scene is seen.

2001-12-30 15:24 +0000 [r255]  robert:

	* Moved the old by hand ChangeLog to ChangeLog.preCVS and then ran
	  cvs2cl.pl to automatically generate the new ChangeLog.

2001-12-30 15:12 +0000 [r254]  robert:

	* Did a make docs, in preperation for 0.8.43 release.

2001-12-30 15:01 +0000 [r252-253]  robert:

	* Compilation fix to pfb plugin, sent in by Ulrich Hertlein.

	* Added a comment in Windows section on INSTALL notes such that it
	  now recommends that you build all the libs.

2001-12-29 20:53 +0000 [r251]  robert:

	* Added .README to prevent CVS from deleting the empty bin
	  directory when checking out copies. This was a problem with the
	  nightly tarballs.

2001-12-29 14:27 +0000 [r250]  robert:

	* Added comment to osg::Transform w.r.t use of GL_NORMALIZE when
	  using scaling Transforms.

2001-12-29 12:28 +0000 [r249]  robert:

	* Updates form Randall Hopper for the FreeBSD build

2001-12-27 20:06 +0000 [r248]  robert:

	* Made inline documentation on the Values enum clearer w.r.t the
	  function of OVERRIDE_ON and OVERRIDE_OFF.

2001-12-26 20:55 +0000 [r247]  robert:

	* Added more details about using stereo with the OSG, in particular
	  the role of the camera manipulators and the fusion distance.

2001-12-24 23:34 +0000 [r246]  robert:

	* Updated doc++ references so that CVS knows about all the newly
	  generated files.

2001-12-24 23:28 +0000 [r245]  robert:

	* Updated the index.html to include references to the new osgText
	  library and demo app.

2001-12-24 23:14 +0000 [r244]  robert:

	* Removed references to redundent environmental variables.

2001-12-24 21:56 +0000 [r243]  robert:

	* Did a make docs.

2001-12-24 21:34 +0000 [r242]  robert:

	* Fixed the osg::Light so that it requires the user to explicitly
	  define which OpenGL light is being operated on, and also now
	  relies upong the standard osg::State handling of OpenGL modes to
	  switch on the appropriate lights. The previous static counter
	  mechansim for the light number was causing a redundent light to
	  be created when the osg plugin created the first osg::Light to
	  use a prototype for other osg::Light's to be cloned from in the
	  .osg plugin execution. The static count mechanism also prevent
	  the lights modes being controlled independantly from the setting
	  of the light paramters themselves. This meant that a light once
	  created was global, and couldn't be turned off locally via the
	  OSG's support for OpenGL mode enabling/disabling. This has been
	  overcome with the new implementation, the user has complete
	  flexiblity of when and where to use the different lights at their
	  disposal.

2001-12-24 19:06 +0000 [r241]  robert:

	* Updated the osgGLUT::Viewer to subclass from osgGLUT::Window as
	  has been intended since the development of osgGLUT::Window.

2001-12-24 15:12 +0000 [r240]  robert:

	* updates for windows build

2001-12-24 14:12 +0000 [r239]  robert:

	* Various clean ups for the release.

2001-12-22 22:30 +0000 [r238]  robert:

	* Updates to keep things compiling under Windows. Also cleaned up
	  the new stereo.html docs.

2001-12-22 21:35 +0000 [r237]  robert:

	* Added beginnings on documentation for stereo support, the
	  stereo.html needs to be re-edited in a html editor before it
	  becomes readable though..

2001-12-22 14:55 +0000 [r236]  robert:

	* Updated usage messages to include new stereo and stencil
	  commandline options.

2001-12-21 22:48 +0000 [r235]  robert:

	* Further work on improving stereo support in the OSG. Renamed the
	  osg::VisualsSettings to osg::DisplaySettings, and
	  osgUtil::VisualsRequirementsVisitor to
	  osgUtil::DisplayRequirementsVisitor. Added support for
	  OSG_SCREEN_HEIGHT into osg::DisplaySettings, and added a
	  DisplaySettings* to the constructors of osg::SceneView and
	  osg::Camera.

2001-12-21 13:07 +0000 [r234]  robert:

	* Updates to the support for stereo in osg::Camera,
	  osgUtil::SceneView and the CameraManipulators.

2001-12-20 20:48 +0000 [r233]  robert:

	  StateAttribute.

2001-12-20 16:35 +0000 [r231-232]  robert:

	* Updates to the camera code related to stereo, adding fusion
	  distance.

	* Added check for null models be returned form
	  osgDB::readNodeFiles(..) to prevent execution when no models have
	  been loaded.

2001-12-20 12:12 +0000 [r230]  robert:

	* Updates to flt loading of light points, from Brede Johansen.

2001-12-19 15:20 +0000 [r229]  robert:

	* Updates to Stereo code.

2001-12-19 10:29 +0000 [r228]  robert:

	* Updated the demos to support the new commandline handling of
	  stereo and convinience functios for loading libs and files.

2001-12-19 08:49 +0000 [r227]  robert:

	* Added check for GL_ARB_imaging extension to osg;:ColorMatrix

2001-12-19 01:10 +0000 [r226]  robert:

	* Compilation fixes under for Windows

2001-12-19 00:38 +0000 [r225]  robert:

	* Adding support for controlling visual settings via environmental
	  variables and command line paramters. Including support for
	  stereo and stencil buffer.

2001-12-18 11:28 +0000 [r224]  robert:

	* Added range checking to osg::Camera::adjustAspectRatio to catch
	  invalid values being passed to Camera. Invalid values were
	  occuring when iconising the Windows GLUT based OSG demos.

2001-12-18 10:46 +0000 [r223]  robert:

	* Fixed compilation problems in flt plugin under Windows, and
	  removed usage of the default GeoSet::AtttributeDeleteFunctor from
	  the DynGeoSet since it handled the memory deletion iteself via
	  STL containers.

2001-12-17 21:13 +0000 [r222]  robert:

	* Changed the default field of Y to 45 degrees, as this is probably
	  a better default than 30 degrees (what it was temproarily) or the
	  90 degrees that it was originally.

2001-12-17 17:34 +0000 [r221]  don:

	* Fixed IRIX compile issues with the flt loader.
	  ReaderWriterATTR.cpp had a variable "mips" defined, which is
	  predefined for the IRIX preprocessor. Changed this to _mips.
	  FltFile.cpp had a class and transient variable defined within the
	  scope of member function FltFile::readExternals(), which was
	  causing the IRIX 7.3 compiles to hork. Moved the class definition
	  to outside of the member function scope.

2001-12-17 16:21 +0000 [r220]  don:

	* Fixed IRIX build. Required some namespace fixes and include and
	  link directives in the Makefiles

2001-12-17 15:05 +0000 [r219]  robert:

	* Updated the Optimzer::FatternStaticTransform visit so by default
	  it ignores all dynamic transforms, previously it flattened
	  dynamic transforms as well.

2001-12-17 09:29 +0000 [r218]  robert:

	* Added std:: infront of endl to ensure compilation under Windows.

2001-12-16 22:20 +0000 [r217]  robert:

	* Integrated detailed near clipping plane calculation into
	  osgUtil::CullVisitor, submitted by Sasa Bistroviae.

2001-12-16 16:30 +0000 [r216]  robert:

	* From John Davis, a little addition to the Windows version of the
	  osg::Timer constructor such that a static variable is used to
	  force the constructor to check the number of clock cycles per
	  second once, this means that multiple timers can now be created
	  with incurring a the 1 second delay used for timming the clock
	  speed every time the constructor is called.

2001-12-15 22:44 +0000 [r215]  robert:

	* Updated version numbers to 0.8.43 in prep for the impending
	  release.

2001-12-15 22:41 +0000 [r214]  robert:

	* Added comments on how to set up STLport under Windows and IRIX.

2001-12-15 16:56 +0000 [r213]  robert:

	* Renamed osg::Matric::makeIdent() to osg::Matrix::makeIdentity()
	  to make it consistent with the rest of the osg::Matrix naming.
	  Updated OSG distribution to account for new name. Added support
	  for the STATIC/DYNAMIC osg::Transform::Type to the .osg ASCII
	  reader/writer plugin and the flt reader plugin. Removed the non
	  cost version of osg::Transform::getMatrix() as this could by pass
	  the dirty mechinism.

2001-12-15 10:00 +0000 [r212]  robert:

	* updates for windows build.

2001-12-14 23:18 +0000 [r211]  robert:

	* Fixes to Windows build in liu of the move to using just
	  std::streams.

2001-12-14 21:49 +0000 [r210]  robert:

	* Updated OSG so that the old OSG_USE_IO_DOT_H has be removed from
	  all headers that used it, all references to the Standard C++
	  stream classes use the std::ostream etc convention, all
	  references to "using namespace std" and "using namespace
	  std::ostream etc" have been removed.

2001-12-14 18:06 +0000 [r209]  robert:

	* Updatedwidley used includes to remove most of the float/double
	  warnings generated when compiling under Windows with STLport.

2001-12-14 16:15 +0000 [r208]  robert:

	* Don haved accidentally removed the reference to osg.dsp from the
	  .dsw file, breakin the Windows build.

2001-12-14 15:37 +0000 [r207]  don:

	* Removed ^M from Makefile

2001-12-14 15:16 +0000 [r206]  don:

	* Appeased poor MS VisualStudio by adding the ^M's to all .dsw and
	  .dsp files.

2001-12-14 15:10 +0000 [r205]  don:

	* Fixed newline/cr problem

2001-12-14 14:25 +0000 [r204]  robert:

	* Fixed problem with incorrect combining of some LOD's derived from
	  flt databases. Problem related to the order of the removal of
	  redudent groups and LOD combining, the LOD combining only working
	  properly if done first.

2001-12-14 10:47 +0000 [r203]  robert:

	* Fixes for Win32 build related to changes in using namespace std.

2001-12-14 10:02 +0000 [r202]  robert:

	* Removed all references to using namespace std to help solve
	  compilation problems under Windows and IRIX. Also integrated
	  small change to lib3ds from Drew for IRIX compilation.

2001-12-12 20:29 +0000 [r201]  robert:

	* Made the following name changes to Matrix and Quat to clean them
	  up and make the functionality clear given the name. This will
	  break user code unfortunately so please be away of the following
	  mapping. osg::Matrix::makeTrans(..)?\026 ->
	  osg::Matrix::makeTranslate(..) osg::Matrix::makeRot(..)?\026 ->
	  osg::Matrix::makeRotate(..) osg::Matrix::trans(..)?\026 ->
	  osg::Matrix::translate(..) osg::Quat::makeRot(..)?\026 ->
	  osg::Quat::makeRotate(..) Also updated the rest of the OSG
	  distribution to use the new names, and have removed the old
	  deprecated Matrix methods too.

2001-12-12 15:09 +0000 [r200]  robert:

	* Fixed problems with osg::Matrix::makeRot(from,to) and
	  osg::Quat::makeRot(from,to) so that they both use the same
	  implementation (the Quat code now) and the code has been
	  corrected to work from and to vectors which directly opposite to
	  one another.

2001-12-12 12:55 +0000 [r199]  robert:

	* Fixed problem with loading interleaved arrays in the .osg loader,
	  and corrected a spelling mistake in osg::GeoSet.

2001-12-12 05:09 +0000 [r198]  don:

	* Added translation and scaling to osgconv

2001-12-11 17:00 +0000 [r197]  don:

	* Fixed Matrix::rotate( Vec3 from, Vec3 to); was using to X from to
	  derive axis, which causes a left-handed rotation. Fixed to from X
	  to.

2001-12-11 16:00 +0000 [r196]  robert:

	* Fixed compilation problems under Windows due to changes in using
	  std::ostream etc.

2001-12-11 11:22 +0000 [r194-195]  robert:

	* Removed the 'using namespace std' and replaced with more specific
	  'using std::ostream' this should help prevent polution of the
	  global namespace with std when including these osg include files.

	* Added :Referenced() to the osg::Camera(..) copy constructor to
	  prevent a warning under Linux.

2001-12-09 03:46 +0000 [r193]  don:

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-12-04 22:57 +0000 [r192]  robert:

	* Added support for automatic deletion of osg::GeoSet's attributes,
	  via a default AttributeDeleteFunctor which uses delete []. Users
	  can create their own handlers for the attribute memory to
	  override this default behavior. Fixed a typo in
	  ReaderWriterOBJ.cpp.

2001-12-04 20:38 +0000 [r191]  robert:

	* Various files which should have been checked in earlier but were
	  missed... VisualStudio files for flt loader, and header files or
	  Image and Texture for new osg::Texture::CLAMP_TO_EDGE and
	  osg::Image::dirty.

2001-12-04 19:41 +0000 [r190]  robert:

	* Updates to the flt loader, from Brede Johansen.

2001-12-04 16:03 +0000 [r189]  robert:

	* Integrated Brede Johansen's updates to flt loader.

2001-12-04 15:56 +0000 [r188]  robert:

	* Made a output message output as osg::DEBUG only.

2001-12-04 12:34 +0000 [r187]  robert:

	* Commented out the code to force sgv to use ANAGLYPHIC_STEREO as
	  this should not be the default, will add options to do this
	  later.

2001-12-04 12:31 +0000 [r186]  robert:

	* Improved support for anaglyphic stereo. Integrated texture
	  CLAMP_TO_EDGE, submitted by Ulrich Hertlein.

2001-12-02 22:20 +0000 [r185]  robert:

	* Beginings of support for quad bufferd, red/green, and slit screen
	  stereo.

2001-12-02 08:59 +0000 [r184]  don:

	* Corrected a small booboo in preprocessor guard for header file in
	  GLU and added Matrix::identity() to Matrix

2001-11-30 20:53 +0000 [r183]  robert:

	* Fixed bug in osg::StateSet::merge(..) where the containers were
	  being iterated from begin() to begin() rather than begin() to
	  end().

2001-11-21 15:53 +0000 [r182]  don:

	* Small fix for preprocessor _MP symbol clash with MFC.

2001-11-19 13:14 +0000 [r181]  robert:

	* Made the Warning font file not found message consistent with
	  other file not found messages.

2001-11-19 11:52 +0000 [r180]  robert:

	* Added DLL export to the internal classes in osgUtil::Optimize so
	  that the internal classes can be used directly by client
	  applications.

2001-11-19 10:40 +0000 [r179]  robert:

	* Added warning report for when a font file cannot be found.

2001-11-18 21:31 +0000 [r178]  robert:

	* Added osg::Image::dirtyImage() and setModifiedTag() to allow
	  external updating of the image modified flag to be used in
	  conjunction with texture subloading.

2001-11-15 11:59 +0000 [r177]  robert:

	* Move the call to the manipulators before the scene app traversal
	  to that any changes to the scene graph, such as adding an app
	  callback can be seen by during the same frame.

2001-11-14 15:53 +0000 [r175-176]  robert:

	* Fixes for windows compilation

	* Fixed compilation problem under Wndows

2001-11-14 15:32 +0000 [r174]  robert:

	* Fixed compilation problem under Wndows

2001-11-14 14:10 +0000 [r172-173]  robert:

	* Added osgUtil::TransformCallback to help with rigid body
	  animation.

	* Fixes for IRIX build. Updates to the osg::Transform, adding
	  preMult and postMult methods and deprecating the old
	  preRotate,preTranslate,preScale. Updated the rest of the OSG so
	  that it nolonger uses the deprecated osg::Transform nodes.
	  Renamed osgUtil::SceneView::setGlobalState() to
	  osgUtil::SceneView::setGlobalStateSet() so that the name reflects
	  its functionality better. Updated osgGLUT::Viewer etc to cope
	  with new name change.

2001-11-12 10:04 +0000 [r171]  robert:

	* Added new files to cvs.

2001-11-12 10:00 +0000 [r170]  robert:

	* Added src/osg/NodeCallback.cpp.

2001-11-11 22:32 +0000 [r169]  robert:

	* Fixed compilation error in src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp. Added support
	  for nested NodeCallbacks, allowing them to be chained together so
	  that multiple operations can be applied.

2001-11-10 15:46 +0000 [r168]  robert:

	* Fixed osgUtil::Optimizer::FlatternStaticTransformsVisitor so that
	  the apply(osg::LOD) scaled the ranges in addition to transform
	  the center point and children.

2001-11-10 13:36 +0000 [r167]  robert:

	* Fixed bug related to
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlatternStaticTransform::Visitor's
	  apply(Billboard& ) method which was apply the accumulated
	  transform to the billbaord geometry when it should have been
	  applying the matrix without the transform component.

2001-11-09 15:06 +0000 [r166]  robert:

	* Added osgText::Paragraph which is a subclass from Geode which
	  composes a list of text drawables as a paragraph block, handles
	  breaking of text into individual lines automatically. Changed the
	  osg::Node::setUserData so that the data type has to be an
	  osg::Referenced, and removes the dependancy on
	  osg::MemoryAdapter. I have done this since it simplifies the OSG
	  side of the interface and makes it less like that the user might
	  abuse the memory managment of the data. It does however mean that
	  user data will have by subclassed from Referenced, and therefor
	  may require users to have their own adapter to do this. However,
	  this little nuasance is worth the extra cleaness and robustness
	  afforded by going the osg::Referenced route.

2001-11-09 15:01 +0000 [r165]  robert:

	* Fixed the findFileFile routine which had been broken by a fix of
	  a dlopen problem - './' was added to all files which which
	  directly found without requiring a search path rather than just
	  locally found files, this broke file loads which had wern't local
	  but had a valid path. I have moved the './' work around to inside
	  fileDSO and made it only apply to Linux as I presume this is all
	  it was needed for. Don?

2001-11-08 13:50 +0000 [r164]  robert:

	* Fixed the IntersectVisitor which was broken by a recent patch to
	  catch parallel line and traingle combinations.

2001-11-07 12:42 +0000 [r163]  robert:

	* Added a dirtyBound() to osgUtil::Optimizer. Corrected mispelling
	  of alignment is osg::Text and the osgtext demo. Added guards for
	  divide bu zero's to osg::IntersectVisitor.

2001-11-06 11:36 +0000 [r162]  robert:

	* Fixed inlcude/BoundingBox to compile under Windows.

2001-11-06 11:07 +0000 [r161]  robert:

	* Fixed inlcude/Math to compile under Windows.

2001-11-06 10:34 +0000 [r160]  robert:

	* Added methods to support isNaN,isInfinte and valid to osg::Vec*
	  and osg::Math, and added a guard to IntersectVisitor which uses
	  these new methods to prevent invalid segments being added.

2001-11-04 19:29 +0000 [r159]  robert:

	* Integrated updates to stats sent in my Geoff Michel.

2001-11-02 21:20 +0000 [r158]  don:

	* Fixed findFileInPath to prepend ./ if file is in local directory.
	  This was needed by dlopen() for dso's in the current directory

2001-11-02 20:11 +0000 [r157]  robert:

	* Updates to Makefiles to include osgText. Also a couple of
	  undefined methods in osgText::Text have been added.

2001-11-02 12:26 +0000 [r156]  robert:

	* Updated index.html with dependacy info about the new osgText
	  library. Modified osg/Drawable::draw(..) so that it uses display
	  list COMPILE rather than COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE to solve performance
	  problems under NVidia drivers. The old behavior is still
	  available by comments out a #define. Fixed the default
	  compilation list src/osgPlugins/Makefile so that it compiles by
	  defalt png and gif.

2001-11-01 16:35 +0000 [r155]  robert:

	* Updates to the flt loader from Brede Johansen.

2001-11-01 15:13 +0000 [r154]  robert:

	* Updates to osgText to fix a crash on ikart.tff font available
	  under Linux, the bug was related to texel padding of the height
	  not be accounted for in texture size calculation, but was used
	  during populating the image data causing a mismatch.

2001-10-31 22:35 +0000 [r153]  robert:

	* Added missing config.h file to src/osgPlugins/lib3ds.

2001-10-31 20:04 +0000 [r152]  robert:

	* Added a bool paramter to osg::StateSet::compare(const StateSet&
	  rhs,bool compareAttributeContents=false) const; to allow it to
	  use different comparison schemes, now it can use checking for
	  pointer equality (the default) or attribute contexts. This has
	  been added to assist optimization of databases within the flt
	  loader, but also could be useful for other operations too.

2001-10-31 18:33 +0000 [r151]  robert:

	* Updated the lib3ds plugin with the new 1.1 version of lib3ds.

2001-10-31 12:27 +0000 [r150]  robert:

	* Update to osgText to get things compiling under Windows.

2001-10-31 11:41 +0000 [r149]  robert:

	* Update osgText.dsp to define FTGL_STATICLIBRARY to prevent it
	  compiling the as a seperate library and producing linkage
	  warnings.

2001-10-31 10:20 +0000 [r148]  robert:

	* Updated the FTGL implemention in osgText to FTFL1.1.

2001-10-30 19:23 +0000 [r147]  robert:

	* Further updates to the ReaderWriter support in osgDB, and a fix
	  to a small warning in Matrix.cpp.

2001-10-30 14:20 +0000 [r146]  robert:

	* Added support for ReadResult and WriteResult to the
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter to allo plugins to pass back more information
	  about the success or failure of a file load. All plugins have
	  been updated to the new convention.

2001-10-29 19:29 +0000 [r145]  robert:

	* Changed a #define ... (GLenum) 0x84fe to 0x84FE to fix problems
	  under MacOS9 build.

2001-10-29 12:22 +0000 [r144]  robert:

	* Ran to_unix over src/Demos/osgtext/main.cpp to try and fix some
	  return type problems reported under Windows.

2001-10-29 12:19 +0000 [r143]  robert:

	* Added missing src/osgText/Version.cpp file.

2001-10-25 01:11 +0000 [r142]  bryan:

	* Imposter.cpp added to the project

2001-10-25 00:49 +0000 [r141]  bryan:

	* Changed the int to a GLint because of the differences within
	  mac/win32/linux versions of gl.h.

2001-10-25 00:45 +0000 [r140]  bryan:

	* sgv is almost working

2001-10-24 23:15 +0000 [r139]  robert:

	* Completed work on osgText compilation under Win32. We now have
	  fonts under Wndows and Linux :-)

2001-10-24 22:29 +0000 [r138]  robert:

	* Updates to the visual studio files for osgText.

2001-10-24 19:48 +0000 [r137]  robert:

	* Updates of osgDB/FileUtils to fix compilation problems under
	  Win32

2001-10-24 13:46 +0000 [r136]  robert:

	* Updates to osgText.

2001-10-24 12:53 +0000 [r135]  robert:

	* Updates to osgText and osgDB so that the loading of text fonts
	  can use osgDB::findFile() to locate font files from the
	  OSGFILEPATH environmental variable.

2001-10-24 09:41 +0000 [r134]  robert:

	* Updated FTGL version to 1.0 and removed a couple of warnings in
	  the osgText demo.

2001-10-24 09:08 +0000 [r133]  robert:

	* Updated the osgText implemention, now works under Linux.

2001-10-23 23:23 +0000 [r132]  don:

	* Added stat.c

2001-10-23 23:15 +0000 [r131]  don:

	* One last change needed to makedefs.linux to sync Linux and Irix
	  pfb loader

2001-10-23 23:10 +0000 [r130]  don:

	* Fixed pfb loader functionality for IRIX

2001-10-23 22:59 +0000 [r129]  don:

	* Fixed pfb loader so that it works for both Linux and IRix with
	  dynamic libraries, and provides support to load (almost) all that
	  Performer loads.

2001-10-23 22:28 +0000 [r128]  robert:

	* Further work on getting osgText compiling.

2001-10-23 22:12 +0000 [r125-127]  robert:

	* Removed old .cc versions of FT font code.

	* Adding in new .cpp versions of FT font code.

	* Updates to the new osgText library to get it to compile under
	  Linux.

2001-10-23 20:04 +0000 [r124]  robert:

	* Converted FTGL files from mac style return to unix style.

2001-10-23 19:51 +0000 [r123]  robert:

	* First past integrat of Max Rhiener work on wrapping FTGL to
	  create osgText library and demo.

2001-10-23 15:55 +0000 [r122]  robert:

	* Added new osgGLUT::Window base class which is very basic right
	  now, all it does is bring up a GLUT window and provide virtual
	  functions from which users should subclass to add functionality.

2001-10-22 22:02 +0000 [r121]  robert:

	* Integrated Geoff Michel's updates to Stats code, whilest move all
	  text rendering back in the viewer from the Statistics header.
	  Added a osg::State::captureCurrentState(StateSet&) method and a
	  copy constructor to osg::StateSet.

2001-10-21 21:27 +0000 [r120]  robert:

	* Moved all #include "osg/.." references to #include <osg/..> to
	  aid port to MacOS.

2001-10-20 20:26 +0000 [r119]  robert:

	* Added support for an osgUtil::SceneView::init() traversal which
	  is called once per scene view. The user can attach a NodeVisitor
	  to do init for them, or leave it to the default which is to use
	  the osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor which compiles all display lists
	  and texture objects. The init traversal is called automatically
	  by the first call to either app() or cull(), so should not be
	  called by user code during initialization. This ensures that a
	  valid graphics context has been established before OpenGL is
	  initialized. osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor has also been updated to
	  use a bit mask for options, and the addition of compilation of
	  texture objects (via StateAttribute::compile) has also been
	  added.

2001-10-20 09:48 +0000 [r118]  robert:

	* Added #ifdef to Performer ReaderWriterPFB so that pfdLoadFile is
	  used under IRIX and pfdLoadFile_pfb is used under Linux.

2001-10-19 15:53 +0000 [r117]  robert:

	* Removed Lighting.cpp from repository, it is nolonger used and was
	  just hanging around erroneously.

2001-10-19 15:30 +0000 [r116]  robert:

	* Updated the osgUtil::Optimize so that the call to
	  Optimize::StateVisitor is #ifdef out under Win32 and STL port
	  isn't being used. This prevents crashes due to MS's flacky STL
	  implementation.

2001-10-19 14:22 +0000 [r115]  robert:

	* Added osgUtil::Optimizer which contains four visitor each
	  designed for doing different types of optimization on the scene
	  graph - state optimization, flattening static transforms,
	  combining LOD's and removing redundent groups. The new Optimizer
	  replaces the once seperate OptimizerStateVisitor.

2001-10-19 12:56 +0000 [r114]  robert:

	* Added support for specifying whether view frustum and small
	  feature culling should be applied to a node or its child with the
	  new osg::Node::setCullingActive() flag. A mechanism has been
	  implemented so that if child has its culling disabled then their
	  parents, all the way up to the root are also have their culling
	  implicitly disabled. The osg::CullVisitor has updated to take
	  account of both the explicit control via setCullingActive and the
	  implicit culling disabling through children being disabled. This
	  feature is useful for nodes which don't have a bounding volume to
	  cull against, earth sky implementations and light sources. The
	  default osg::Node::_cullingActive is true, i.e. culling is
	  enabled by default.

2001-10-17 22:17 +0000 [r112]  don:

	* Fixed static libraries in madefs.linux and error in
	  ReaderWriterPFB.cpp

2001-10-16 22:30 +0000 [r111]  bryan:

	* Update the tree to my version of the project file (I thought it
	  was already in) - Hang glide demo works - sgv is still being
	  fixed

2001-10-16 21:47 +0000 [r110]  robert:

	* Reverted Bryan's changes to FrameStamp w.r.t std::tm structure
	  which doesn't compile under Win32 and IRIX. Will need to find
	  another solution.

2001-10-16 21:32 +0000 [r109]  bryan:

	* This was the old project file. It's no longer used.

2001-10-16 20:56 +0000 [r108]  bryan:

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-10-16 18:39 +0000 [r107]  robert:

	* Fixes for IRIX build - submitted by Randall Hopper.

2001-10-16 16:48 +0000 [r106]  robert:

	* Fixes for Win32 compilation.

2001-10-16 15:03 +0000 [r105]  robert:

	* Fixed then normal smoothing function in the .3ds loader and the
	  osgUtil::SmoothingVisitor so that unused normals at left at 0,0,0
	  insead of being normalized, which results in (nan,nan,nan).

2001-10-16 14:24 +0000 [r104]  robert:

	* Completed implementation of a the new CombineLODsVisitor, ideal
	  for use with the .flt loader. Code is stuff currently in sgv, but
	  will be moved out once more testing has been done.

2001-10-16 10:04 +0000 [r102-103]  robert:

	* Added support for transforming LOD and Billboard centers to the
	  OrientationConverter and the flattenTransformVisitor in sgv.

	* Modified Veiewer.cpp so that when toggling the light with 'l' the
	  light can be overrided to off and overrided to on, previoulsy it
	  only overrided to off.

2001-10-16 08:24 +0000 [r101]  robert:

	* Fixed problem caused by ReaderWriterPFB::writeNode(..) not
	  ensuring that the file extension was .pfb. Have added a check.

2001-10-16 03:59 +0000 [r100]  don:

	* added float *() operator to Vec{2,3,4} so we can pass Vec3's
	  directly to OpenGL glVertex?fv().

2001-10-15 15:50 +0000 [r99]  robert:

	* Fixes for compilation under IRIX, submitted by Randal Hopper,
	  with mods from Robert.

2001-10-15 14:29 +0000 [r98]  robert:

	* Made the new global state attribute instances in osg::State use
	  osg:ref_ptr to automatically handle the memory deletion.

2001-10-15 14:07 +0000 [r97]  robert:

	* Added support for automatic creation of global StateAttributes to
	  osg::State, these global attributes are created by cloning any
	  attributes which are applied during rendering, the clone in a
	  shallow copy, which will set up default valus for that attribute.
	  This should prevent attribute bleed from one stateset to the next
	  when the global StateSet doesn't contain an attribute used within
	  the scene graph.

2001-10-15 11:18 +0000 [r96]  robert:

	* Fixed rotations to account to the fixes made to Quat and Matrix
	  related to right hand rule rotation.

2001-10-15 08:40 +0000 [r95]  robert:

	* The writeImage/Object/Node methods in the .osg and .pfb
	  reader/writer didn't have the new ReaderWriter::Options*
	  structure passed to them, which meant the the virtual functions
	  didn't bind with the new base class methods and wern't called on
	  a write.

2001-10-15 03:32 +0000 [r94]  don:

	* Updated pfb loader to load pfb files into osg. Still broken for
	  loading osg files into Performer, however.

2001-10-14 17:54 +0000 [r93]  robert:

	* Added osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options class to the ReaderWriter base
	  class, support for settings options in osgDB::Registry, and added
	  the paramter to all of the reaader/writer plugins. The Options
	  structure by default has an string attached for packing basic
	  options, however, it also can be subclassed to encapsulate any
	  users defined option data. In the later case both the client code
	  *and* the plugin need to be aware of subclass, the plugin will
	  need to use dynamic_cast<> to assertain its type.

2001-10-14 16:56 +0000 [r91-92]  robert:

	* Added OrientationConverter.cpp to the VisualStudio project files
	  for osgconv.

	* Changed the OrientationConverter.cpp's to have consitent
	  captilization as its associated header file.

2001-10-14 14:23 +0000 [r89-90]  robert:

	* Fixed TransformFunctor code so that it now uses the inverse of
	  the transformation matrix to transform the normal.

	* Fixed a bug in Matrix::invert(..) which did not set
	  full_realised=true, so that one Matrices which had not previously
	  be initialized we're erronously initialized later in the code
	  resetting it to identity.

2001-10-14 09:58 +0000 [r87-88]  robert:

	* Added osg::StateSet::merge(const StateSet& rhs) merges merges the
	  modes and attributes of rhs into 'this' stateset.

	* Fixed the Flight and Drive manipulators to work with the updated
	  Matrix::rotate code.

2001-10-14 06:01 +0000 [r86]  don:

	* Fixed a small boo-boo in definition of bit masks in
	  include/osg/Drawable Fixed incorrect normal conversions for
	  osgconv.

2001-10-14 05:33 +0000 [r85]  don:

	* Mr. O added fancy, shmanzy C++ code, but broke normal transform
	  functionality Fixed.

2001-10-14 05:14 +0000 [r84]  don:

	* Quick 'n dirty fix to TrackballManipulator to get the rotations
	  doing the right things after the Quat fixes.

2001-10-14 04:50 +0000 [r83]  don:

	* Cleaned up some 'make clobber' issues in root Makefile

2001-10-14 04:28 +0000 [r82]  don:

	* Quaternions were assigning inverted values during conversion to
	  matricies. This is probably due to an error on the gamasutra web
	  page demonstrating this. It caused left-handed rotations rather
	  than right handed rotations. Should be fixed now.

2001-10-13 11:16 +0000 [r81]  robert:

	* Changed the naming and calling convention of the new
	  Drawable::AttributeFunctor and have updated GeoSet to use mutable
	  values for the _numverts etc, allowing
	  osg::GeoSet::computeNumVerts() to be a const operation.
	  osg::GeoSet::getNumVerts is now a const once more, so avoiding
	  compilation problems. Also chaned the new osgconv orientation
	  code to use a Drawable::AttributeFunctor so it can work on other
	  Drawables other than just GeoSets.

2001-10-13 09:48 +0000 [r80]  don:

	* Added Mr. Osfields dynamic_cast<> and test for validity test.

2001-10-13 08:34 +0000 [r78-79]  don:

	* backed out right-handed coordinate transform for
	  makeRot(vec3,vec3) in Quat.cpp

	* A few more clean ups

2001-10-13 07:41 +0000 [r77]  don:

	* Cleaned up the usage message

2001-10-13 07:24 +0000 [r76]  don:

	* Updated osgconv to be able to handle orientation swapping.

2001-10-13 06:23 +0000 [r74-75]  don:

	* Changed some routines to produce right-handed rotations.

	* checking files in to move development location

2001-10-13 01:28 +0000 [r73]  don:

	* Removed personal note in Matrix header file

2001-10-12 20:06 +0000 [r71-72]  robert:

	* Added support for the new AttributeUpdateFunctors.

	* Added != method to Vec2,Vec3,Vec4 and did further work on the
	  AttributeUpdateFunctors.

2001-10-12 17:45 +0000 [r70]  don:

	* Added include/osg/Math to Makefile TARGET_INCLUDE_FILES and fixed
	  references to _mat in ConvertToPerformer.cpp

2001-10-10 20:20 +0000 [r69]  robert:

	* Added support for DYNAMIC/STATIC osg::Transform types and added
	  new osg::Drawable::getStats and supportsAttributeUpdate(..) and
	  applyAttributeUpdate(...) methods which will be to enable hooks
	  into Drawable subclasses.

2001-10-10 14:38 +0000 [r68]  robert:

	* Fixed spelling of osg::GeoSet::getNumInterleavedIndices, was
	  missing a 'n'!

2001-10-09 21:55 +0000 [r67]  robert:

	* Fixed a crash when opening an erroneous test file (reopen.bmp).

2001-10-09 20:22 +0000 [r66]  robert:

	* Updated to fix build problems under MSVC.

2001-10-09 20:09 +0000 [r65]  robert:

	* Updated MSVC Workspace files to fix build problems.

2001-10-09 20:03 +0000 [r64]  robert:

	* Updated MSVC Workspace files to fix build problems.

2001-10-09 14:18 +0000 [r63]  robert:

	* Merged Ben Discoe's clean up of the MSVC files.

2001-10-09 11:58 +0000 [r62]  robert:

	* Merged updates to BMP plugin from Geoff Michel. Also modified a
	  little of the code to fix a crash under Linux, Robert Osfield

2001-10-08 19:01 +0000 [r61]  robert:

	* Put the makedefs.linux back to default to optimize.

2001-10-08 15:54 +0000 [r60]  robert:

	* Fixed a recently introduced crash in the flt plugin which was
	  happen when a std::string was be be set with NULL char*. Also
	  added support for stripping the filename from its original path,
	  inside the osgDB::findFile function.

2001-10-08 08:35 +0000 [r59]  robert:

	* Added support for using osgDB::fineFile into the .flt plugin.

2001-10-07 20:10 +0000 [r58]  robert:

	* Merged Geoff Michel's udpdates to bmp plugin, and fixed a double
	  fclose bug which was causing a seg fault under Linux.

2001-10-06 20:29 +0000 [r57]  robert:

	* Added a osg::DegreesToRadians() and osg::RadiansToDegrees()
	  method to osg/Math, updated the ReaderWriterBMP.cpp (mods sent in
	  my Geoff Michel) and moved the osgUtil::Statistics to
	  osg::Statistics in preperation to adding it to the the Drawable
	  base class.

2001-10-05 19:55 +0000 [r56]  robert:

	* Added bmp plugin files, bmp plguin written by Geoff Michel

2001-10-05 10:39 +0000 [r54-55]  robert:

	* Added bmp osgPlugin, written by Geoff Michel.

	* Fixed a bug in osg::Image::ensureDimensionsArePowerOfTwo() which
	  only scaled dimensions if *both* axis wern't a power of two, have
	  fixed it to rescale if either of the axis arn't a power to two.

2001-10-05 01:27 +0000 [r53]  bryan:

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-10-04 16:49 +0000 [r52]  robert:

	* Added the Copyright message to the top of osgWX, with Ben Disoe's
	  name as he wrote all the code.

2001-10-04 15:12 +0000 [r51]  robert:

	* Added a copyright notice to all core headers, which all begin
	  with //C++ header to help scripts and editors pick up the fact
	  that the file is a header file.

2001-10-04 14:39 +0000 [r50]  robert:

	* Changed the ordering of comparing modes and attributes in
	  osg::StateAttribute::compare() as part of an investigration into
	  state sorting.

2001-10-04 14:35 +0000 [r49]  robert:

	* Added an implemention of basic state sorting to the RenderBin,
	  but have commented out the sort operation as Peformance benifit
	  is currently negligable, will need to improve on the sort functor
	  to see real benifits.

2001-10-04 14:25 +0000 [r48]  robert:

	* Added extra precision to the app,cull and draw timings in the
	  Viewer.

2001-10-04 14:20 +0000 [r47]  robert:

	* Removed some notify which were only used for debugging of the
	  camera class and are now redudent.

2001-10-04 14:10 +0000 [r46]  robert:

	* Changed the numeric ordering of StateAttributes Types, as part of
	  an investigation into state sorting.

2001-10-03 21:44 +0000 [r45]  robert:

	* Integrated changes for MacOSX, submitted by Phil Atkin, with
	  small mods by Robert Osfield to maintain compatability under
	  Linux.

2001-10-03 07:56 +0000 [r44]  robert:

	* Added missing EarthSky.cpp file to osg plguin.

2001-10-02 15:59 +0000 [r43]  robert:

	* Added include/osg/EarthSky and src/osg/EarthSky to cvs. Also move
	  osg across to using radians for angular paramters by default. By
	  defining USE_DEGREES_INTERNALLY you can get the OSG to revert to
	  the old style degrees. This later feature is deprecated and only
	  meant for helping comptability in the interim.

2001-10-02 11:36 +0000 [r42]  robert:

	* Added osg::EarthSky node to the core osg library, and added
	  support for it into osgUtil::SceneView, osg::CullVisitor,
	  osgPlugin/osg and updated the hangglide demo to use the new earth
	  sky node.

2001-10-01 23:02 +0000 [r41]  robert:

	* Added support for osg::StateSet comparison operators and using
	  this new feature added support in osgUtil::OptimizeStateVisitor
	  for removing duplicate StateSet's from the scene graph,
	  previously only duplicated StateAttributes we're removed.

2001-10-01 12:06 +0000 [r40]  robert:

	* Integrated a bug fix to osg::TexMat from Geoff Michel which adds
	  a glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW ); after the setting of the texture
	  matrix. Previously the texture matrix mode could run into normal
	  model view matrix operations which were assuming the defaul of
	  GL_MODELVIEW.

2001-10-01 11:15 +0000 [r39]  robert:

	* Made spelling corrections, the spelling mistakes picked up by a
	  script written by Neil Salter. script

2001-09-30 20:41 +0000 [r38]  robert:

	* Interegrated changes to Timer from Neil Salter to fix compilation
	  problems which had been introduced by doing #include's within the
	  osg namespace.

2001-09-29 18:34 +0000 [r37]  robert:

	* Added setAttributeAndModes(new Depth,StateAttribute::ON); to the
	  StateSet::setGlobalDefault() so that the correct default for the
	  glDepthFunc etc are set up for scene graphs, and allows override
	  of these value which risk of inheriting state on to the rest of
	  the scene graph. This has allowed the hangglide demo to be
	  simplified since it now doesn't need to set the global Depth
	  instance itself.

2001-09-29 09:37 +0000 [r36]  robert:

	* Modified the Matrix multiple method added by Don so it is safer
	  and added comments explaining why it shouldn't be needed as other
	  more efficient methods should be doing the work for us. Also
	  added Matrix::ensureRealized() to support the lazy initialization
	  of Matrix, whilest keeping the implementation robust so that
	  external calls to Matrix which get values do so on an initialized
	  matrix.

2001-09-29 02:48 +0000 [r35]  don:

	* Added operator * (Matrix &) to Matrix (header) and operator [] to
	  reference matrix elements.

2001-09-28 20:10 +0000 [r34]  robert:

	* Made spelling corrections to osg include files, spelling mistakes
	  detected by a script written by Neil Salter which analyses
	  comments for mistakes.

2001-09-28 19:36 +0000 [r33]  don:

2001-09-22 02:04 +0000 [r25]  don:

	* Added files to keep cvs from removing empty directories lib and
	  lib/osgPlugins

2001-09-20 01:07 +0000 [r24]  don:

	* Added place holder README files to lib/README and
	  lib/osgUtil/README so empty directories will not be removed by
	  CVS

2001-09-20 00:59 +0000 [r23]  don:

2001-09-20 00:48 +0000 [r21-22]  don:

	* Addec binary files with -kb

	* Removed should be binary entries. Well r-add with -kb

2001-09-20 00:07 +0000 [r19-20]  don:

	* Added ico files with -kb flag

	* Trying to clean up binary commits

2001-09-19 23:56 +0000 [r17-18]  don:

	* Added these with the -kb flag now.

	* Cleaning up binary commits - oops

2001-09-19 23:52 +0000 [r16]  don:

	* 1) new implementation of the osg::Matrix class. Note details
	  below. 2) cleaned up osg::Timer, still in progress. My intent has
	  been to pave the way for support for other OS's. 3) new
	  osg::FrameStamp class which has a frame number, reference time
	  for each frame to be app, culled and drawn. The FrameStamp also
	  can be passed to other machines (i.e. cluster) and the FrameStamp
	  can be used with the slaves own app,cull and draw. I've also
	  added the beginings of a calander time data to the FrameStamp to
	  allow time or day and year to be used in setting up position of
	  sun/moon etc. etc. 4) The osg::State now has contains a pointer
	  to the last applied osg::Camera and the current osg::FrameStamp,
	  so that drawables can use both pieces of information for creating
	  effects such CLOD, earth/sky etc. The osg::NodeVisitor also now
	  allows you to attach a FrameStamp to support syncronization of
	  actions on the scene graph.

2001-09-19 23:46 +0000 [r15]  don:

	* o Added osgUtil::StateOptimizeVisitor which traversing the scene
	  graph and builds up a map of all StateAttributes and StateSets
	  and then removes the duplicates. This promotes state sharing
	  throughout the scene graph which inturn can significantly improve
	  performance thanks to reduced state changing. Particularily
	  effective on datasets where a great deal of duplicated state
	  exists. o Added pure virtual compare(const osg::StateAttribute&)
	  method to osg::StateAttribute, and implemented it in all the
	  subclasses from StateAttribute. Added <,== & != operator on
	  StateAttribute and Matrix to support new StateOptimizeVisitor. o
	  Added META_Object, META_Node and META_StateAttribute macros to
	  Object, Node and StateAttribute respectively which define the
	  standard pure virtual methods such as clone, className &
	  isSameKindAs. Changed all the appropriate header files to use
	  these macro's rather define them in each header, these cleans up
	  the headers considerably. o Corrected the implementation of
	  osg::Light::getType so it correctly uses a unique type for each
	  of the OpenGL lights (GL_LIGHT0.. GL_LIGHT7 relates to
	  osg::StateAttriburte::LIGHT_0..LIGHT_7. o Changed the definition
	  of osg::StateStateAttribute::Type to is now a unsigned int rather
	  than an enum, and have changed the name of the previous Type enum
	  list to be Types. This makes it more consistent with the
	  difination of values found in StateAttribute and also easier to
	  extend with having to cast to an enum. o From Pail Fredrikson,
	  updated Maitrx.new implemention which uses the same matrix
	  orientation as the original Matrix implemention.

2001-09-19 23:41 +0000 [r14]  don:

	* o Updated Metrowerks files for MacOS. They aren't 100% there yet,
	  but getting there. o First cut of osgcluster demo. Very simple
	  beginings. Alas I only one PC here so I can't test it in its
	  current guise. o New support for NodeCallbacks, via AppCallback
	  attached to osg::Node's, and a default osgUtil::AppVisitor which
	  calls them on each frame. o Support for traversal masks in
	  osg::NodeVisitor, osg::Node which allows nodes to be switched on
	  or off via a bit mask. o Suppport for traversal number (frame
	  number) and reference time into osg::NodeVisitor to handle
	  syncronization of app and cull traversals. This also assist
	  clustering as traversal number master to slaves.
