o Core OSG Library
  ================
    - General
        . Header & code documentation/reference guide.
        . Programming guide.
        . Naming conventions.
        . mutli-threading/shared memory support.

    - Maths
        . full maths support in osg::Matrix class.
        . double matrix class.
        . osg::Plane class.

    - Nodes
        . create a base class to provide interface to objects which can render,
          derive osg::GeoSet from this.
        . add osg::Sequence for basic animation.
        . add osg::Morph for interpolating between geometries.
        . add support for Multi-texturing into osg::GeoSet/osg::GeoState.
        . add support for multi-pass rendering.
        . utilise stl vectors for osg::GeoSets?
        . improve osg::GeoState.
        . add osg::State for mainting image of the OpenGL state.
        . add osg::Terrain node.
        . add osg::EarthSky class for rendering earth and sky backgrounds.
        . add proxy node for lazy loading of nodes, when needed.
        . implement visual proximity to assist loading of proxied data
          when the view frustum nears an unloaded proxy node, and deleting
          of unused proxied data.
        . implement support for modified status/lazy evaluation of node data 
          and observer style pattern.
        . manipulator decoration nodes?
        . spacial subdivision decoration nodes?
        
    - Visitors
        . improve state sorting of opaque bins in osg::RenderVistor.
        . add statistics visitor for logging the stats of the scene graph.
        . add OpenGL picking visitor.
        
    - IO/Plug-in support
        . improve the ascii parsing class osg::Field, osg::FieldReader etc.
        . change the osg::Registry to timestamp registrations of objects/RW's.
        . add support for file path logging into osg::Input.
        . add binary data reading and writing into osg::Input/osg::Output to
          support part binary .osg files.
        . return error messages of on failed loading/saving.

o Under development 
  =================
    Sign up here if would like to take on a task :-)

o Work completed
  ==============
    - osg namespace implemented.
    - reduce the STL platform specific #ifdef's.

      instead of the plug-in functions found in sg.cxx.  
    - add support for removal of plug-ins from osg::Registry,
    - add .osg support into DCS node.
    - clean up inheritance relationship between osg::Node, osg::Object etc.
    - add osg::Switch for handling optional rendering of children.
