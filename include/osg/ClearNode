/** ClearNode is a Group node which controls the clearing of the color and depth

  * The earth sky by default is empty and simply holds the clear color of
  * the background. However, if the uses wants to add their own clearing of
  * the color and depth buffers then the children can be added, and the
  * background clear turned off. The ClearNode by default has StateSet attached
  * to it which sets the default ClearNode bin number to -1, so that all drawables
  * below it are placed in a separate bin from the rest of the scene graph, and
  * are rendered prior to standard opaque and transparent drawables.
