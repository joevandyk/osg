\namespace osgProducer

The osgProducer is a utility library integrates OpenProducer to provide a general purpose viewer classes.  
osgProducer is used by all the OpenSceneGraph examples, and can also be used for client application development.

Note, the core scene graph libraries and NodeKits are entirely Windowing API agnostic so you are free to implement
your own integration with whichever Windowing toolkit you prefer.
